High schools will reopen on June 2 and elementary schools will return to full schedules on June 8, Rutte said, detailing a decision by the Dutch government.  The easing will take place nearly two and a half months after lockdown measures were imposed across the country of 17 million in mid-March.  \u201cWe earned the space we are getting for sticking to the guidelines,\u201d Rutte said in a live television broadcast. \u201cWe have to stick to the rules because we know the virus can flare up again.\u201d  The number of infections from the novel coronavirus rose by 108 to 44,249 on Tuesday, with 21 new deaths over the last 24 hours. The death toll stood at 5,715, national health authorities said.   Cafes and restaurants will be permitted to open on June 1, with a maximum of 30 guests, Rutte said. People must keep 1.5 metres apart from others, unless they live together. Museums will also reopen, but tickets will only be sold online in advance to avoid crowds.  Homes for the elderly, where infection rates have been relatively high, will again allow visitors, with more widespread testing available to reduce risks.  Public transport will also resume regular schedules, with non-medical face masks compulsory for anyone over 13 years of age. Only essential travel will be allowed and less than half of seats will be available.  Gyms and dance venues will remain closed and large sporting events banned, probably until Sept. 1.

The one-year IMF programme would help with any payment gaps businesses face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Repayment would be spread out over the medium term.  Hala Saeed told the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt on a video conference that it would include financing from bilateral and multilateral sources.  In 2016, Egypt agreed a $12 billion, three-year Extended Fund Facility programme with the International Monetary Fund designed to reduce its fiscal and balance of payment deficits.    \u201cThe 2016 programme was more on the fiscal and monetary side,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cAfter the success of the first phase of reform, we are continuing the structural reform programme.\u201d    She said Egypt had already been working on structural reforms before the pandemic and had identified six priorities, including digital transformation, industry, agriculture and logistics.  Central bank deputy governor Rami Aboul Naga said last week  Egypt was in talks with the IMF for more financial support. When asked about a Bloomberg News report that Egypt would seek a further $5 billion from the IMF and $4 billion from other sources for a total of $9 billion, Naga told Al Arabiya news channel that the number was close to that figure.  The IMF last week had already approved one financing package for Egypt - a $2.77 billion Rapid Financing Instrument - to help Cairo close a gap in its balance of payments caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Saeed said the economy grew by nearly 5% in the Jan-March quarter, down from 5.8% expected before the pandemic.  \u201cIt is 0.8 less than what we were aiming for, however, we are still positive with a high growth rate.\u201d   The government had been counting on the higher growth to help Egypt absorb the 750,000 to 850,000 workers who enter the labour market each year as well as part of the backlog in unemployment, she added.

The states said Santander violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with subprime credit\u00a0into auto loans it knew carried a high probability of default. Santander has agreed to pay $65 million for restitution for some customers and to waive deficiency balances on loans worth $478 million. It will also pay $7 million to the states to manage restitution claims.  Santander, the nation\u2019s largest subprime auto financing company and an arm of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA that went public in 2014, said it was pleased to resolve the investigation and \u201cno additional charges will be taken in connection with the settlement.\u201d  \u201cSantander profited by approving high-cost loans to disadvantaged auto buyers who were doomed from the start,\u201d\u00a0said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement.  California said Santander approved loans it expected would default at rates of greater than 70% and alleged \u201cSantander\u2019s aggressive pursuit of market share led it to underestimate the risk associated with loans by turning a blind eye to dealer abuse.\u201d  For some consumers who defaulted but have not had their cars repossessed, Santander is required to allow them to keep them and waive loan balances up to a total of $45 million and to waive deficiency balances on other loans totaling $433 million.    Santander agreed not to purchase loans where consumers would likely have no money left over monthly and not to require auto dealers to sell add-on \u201cback-end\u201d products to consumers.

Pier 1, which operates about 541 stores in the U.S., said in a statement that it intends to sell its inventory and remaining assets, including its intellectual property and e-commerce business, through a court-supervised process.  \u201cUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Riesbeck said.   Pier 1 said it will continue to serve its customers through its online operations, Pier1.com, and will start closing stores  and begin sales liquidation once stores can reopen based on COVID-19 guidelines from local government officials.

Israel does not have diplomatic relations with any of the six Gulf Arab countries, and there are no commercial flights between them. It has relations with only two Arab countries: Egypt and Jordan.   However, shared concerns over Iran\u2019s influence in the region have led to a discrete thaw in ties between Israel and the Arab Gulf in recent years.   That thaw has been accompanied by a slight relaxation of stringent air travel rules. In 2018, Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel - an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv.   \u201cEtihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,\u201d an Etihad spokeswoman said, adding that there were no passengers on board.  An official at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport said the flight would arrive at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).   The United Nations coordinated a 14-tonne shipment of \u201curgent medical supplies\u201d from the UAE to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in the Palestinian territories, according to a statement from the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO).  \u201cThe aid includes personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical equipment. Most notably, it includes 10 ventilators that are acutely needed,\u201d the statement added.  It was not immediately clear whether the 14 tonnes of aid were transported on the Tuesday Etihad cargo flight. Etihad was not mentioned in the UNSCO statement.  Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank had no immediate comment. Health officials in the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas, said they had no knowledge of any aid shipment for Gaza from Abu Dhabi.

In the biggest confidence booster, the Federal Reserve has bought $1.5 trillion in Treasuries since mid-March, hoping to stabilize the more than $17-trillion market after it seized up during the pandemic. It has been buying both short-term and long-term debt, but tapered purchases this week to a daily average of $6 billion, from $7 billion the previous week, as liquidity improved.  Treasury will initially offer $20 billion 20-year bonds and will sell a total of $54 billion over the next three months. The last 20-year was sold in 1986.  \u201cThere\u2019s demand for all bonds at this time because the Fed has created the backstop. They\u2019re the buyer of last resort,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist, at Incapital.   Solid demand at last week\u2019s auction of U.S. three-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds augured well for the 20-year bond sale.  \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why the 20-year won\u2019t go just fine,\u201d Leary said.  All three auctions showed higher participation from indirect bidders including foreign central banks.  \u201cIf surging issuance leads to undesirably high term premiums at the long-end of the Treasury curve, the Fed will quickly ramp purchases back up to squash them,\u201d said Ryan Swift, U.S. bond strategist at BCA Research.  The auction could draw good interest from foreign investors. As the Fed cut U.S. interest rates to near zero, their costs have dropped for neutralizing currency exposure of owning dollar-denominated assets.   Prohibitive hedging costs had deterred some foreign investors in Europe and Japan from buying U.S. assets because returns eroded as dollars were converted back to their home currencies.   A Japanese investor buying U.S. 30-year Treasuries, would pick up a yield of 51 basis points, compared with 45 basis points when he purchases Japanese government bonds, according to Barclays data.  For a European investor, buying 30-year Treasuries shows a yield pick-up 48 basis points, and for UK investors, the yield is 117 basis points.  \u201cThe Japanese will buy the 20-year,\u201d said Zoltan Pozsar, managing director at Credit Suisse in New York. \u201cBuying the 10-year on a hedged-basis is profitable, but not that profitable, so the 20-year will price for a better yield.\u201d  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Alden Bentley and David Gregorio","6":"(Reuters) - Businesses will face weak demand as long as consumers and workers are worried about public health, and the unemployment rate is likely to stay in the double digits at the end of the year, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday.   The unemployment rate could peak at close to 20% as more Americans lose jobs in the shutdowns put in place across the country to limit the spread of the coronavirus, and the losses could linger, Rosengren said in remarks prepared for a webinar hosted by the New England Council.   \u201cUnfortunately, even by the end of the year, I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double-digit levels,\u201d he said.   Policymakers will take action to help reduce the length of time that people are out of work and some of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending facilities helped to ease the pressure in short-term funding markets, Rosengren said.    The Main Street Lending Facility, which aims to make credit available to small and medium sized businesses, should launch by the end of the month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday.  Businesses that meet the requirements will be able to turn to their lenders for a loan, Rosengren said. However, the program will not help all businesses in need, he cautioned.   \u201cIt will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an important bridge for many businesses that employ much of the American workforce,\u201d Rosengren said.   As businesses reopen, many people will be nervous about returning to the workplace and demand for many services will stay low until those concerns are lifted, he said.   \u201cIn sum, simply allowing businesses to reopen is not a panacea,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cPublic health solutions are paramount \u2013 without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment.\u201d  Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","7":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers that grow crops such as corn or soybeans will receive coronavirus assistance payments based on either half of their 2019 production or the supplies they had on hand as of Jan. 15, the government said on Tuesday.

Other crops such as barley, canola, cotton and oats also were eligible for payment under the plan.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the agency\u2019s role after the United States again withheld full support for a resolution on the pandemic.  \u201cWe want accountability more than anyone,\u201d Tedros told a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019S 194 member states. \u201cWe will continue providing strategic leadership to coordinate the global response.\u201d  Washington allowed the resolution calling for a review into the global response to the pandemic to pass by consensus, but said it objected to language about reproductive health rights and permission for poor countries to waive patent rules.  WHO officials running the meeting clapped and cheered after the resolution was passed without a vote hours after Trump tweeted his threat to pull the United States out of the body.  It calls for a review into the WHO-led global response, something the United States has demanded.  But the U.S. mission in Geneva said in a statement that paragraphs on the right of poor countries to waive patents to obtain medicine during a health emergency would \u201csend the wrong message to innovators\u201d trying to produce new drugs and vaccines.  The reproductive healthcare language could be interpreted as requiring countries to permit abortion. \u201cThe United States believes in legal protections for the unborn,\u201d it said.  China and the United States also sparred in the closing moments of the assembly over the issue of Taiwan. Taiwan lobbied hard to be included as an observer at the two-day meeting and received support from the United States, Japan and others, but says it was not invited due to opposition from China.  Even as Trump has proposed quitting the WHO, the body has received backing and a two-year pledge of $2 billion in funds from China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.  Many other leaders expressed support for Tedros.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for international cooperation in response to the pandemic.  \u201cAt times like these, the greatest act of courage is to play as a team,\u201d she continued, without an overt reference to the United States.  During his three years in office, Trump has criticised many international organisations and quit some. Still, European diplomats said they were taken aback by Washington\u2019s decision to stand aside at the WHO while China is boosting its role.  \u201cIt was so striking to see Xi Jinping seizing the opportunity to open up, with broad (cooperation), and make a proposal for $2 billion, and say if ever there is a vaccine they will share it with everyone,\u201d a European diplomat said.  \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we feared: the space liberated by Washington will be taken up by China.\u201d  The WHO declined to comment on Trump\u2019s threat to quit, saying only that it had received his letter and was considering its contents.  Tuesday\u2019s resolution calls for a review into how the novel coronavirus spread after making the jump from animals to humans, believed to have happened in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year.   Some countries including hard-hit Spain and Italy suggested the body could emerge stronger from the pandemic through reform.  \u201cThis should be a time for renewing our organisation and we renew our strong commitment to the organisation,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.

Almost 32,000 Italians have died of COVID-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after the United States and Britain.   Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in early March, only permitting an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.  Monday marked a major step forward on the road to recovery, with unlimited travel allowed in individual regions, friends once again meeting up and restaurants able to serve as long as tables were at least 2 metres (6.5 ft) apart.

U.S. and Canadian officials had said last week it was likely the measure would be rolled over until June 21.   \u201cThis is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe,\u201d Trudeau told reporters. The ban, initially introduced in mid-March, had already been extended in April until May 21.  U.S. officials were not immediately available for comment.  Bilateral relations have steadily improved since a low point in June 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump accused Trudeau of being weak after a Group of Seven summit.  Trump though said on Tuesday that Washington should consider terminating trade deals under which it imports cattle as it looks to help domestic producers. A new free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico comes into effect on July 1.  Canadian officials were not immediately available for comment. Canada exported $2.75 billion worth of beef in 2018, 74% of it to the United States, according to the Canadian Cattlemen\u2019s Association lobby group.  The temporary ban on non-essential travel does not cover trade across a border that stretches 5,525 miles (8,891 km). Canada sends 75% of all goods exports to the United States.  Trudeau said Canada\u2019s 10 provinces had made it clear they wanted the measures to be rolled over.  When non-essential travel restarted, Canada would need \u201cto have strong measures in place\u201d, he said, but gave no details.     Canada\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak edged up by less than 1% to 5,857 from 5,805 on Monday, easily the lowest daily increase since the crisis started, official data showed.

Powell and Mnuchin were testifying to the Senate Banking Committee as Congress considers whether to roll out trillions of dollars of additional aid to bolster an economy that was brought to a virtual standstill by lockdowns imposed in March and April.  The Trump administration has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  Essential workers \u201cput their lives on the line for very low wages, and they\u2019re still worried about paying their bills. Is that fair?,\u201d Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio, asked Mnuchin.   When Mnuchin started to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d Brown interrupted him. \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d   Senators are also expected to have sharp questions about the additional actions needed to keep the world's largest economy afloat, and missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far. (See graphic here showing how the money moved.)  The hearing https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov started at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) and was expected to last two hours.    As more states reopen businesses, the government is closing in on the end of an eight-week program to funnel money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, prompting calls to extend the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program. President Donald Trump said on Monday that such an extension \u201cshould be easy.\u201d  Fiscal relief so far has been lopsided, with big banks getting easy access to Fed backstops, but mom-and-pop businesses initially shut out of paycheck lending programs. Meanwhile, some of the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers are doing the most dangerous jobs.  While over 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin, in written testimony published on Tuesday, said he sees high unemployment during the second quarter, but that the overall situation is expected to improve as the economy starts to reopen.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Powell, in prepared remarks for the hearing, said the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March was \u201ccritical\u201d to the U.S. central bank\u2019s ability to expand credit throughout the economy to offset the blow from the coronavirus.  Other programs aimed at helping larger companies and municipal bond issuers through a sharp recession are just getting started.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  In remarks broadcast on Sunday night, Powell said  unemployment may hit 25% before it begins to fall, with a contraction in gross domestic product of 20% or more. He added that positive \u201cmedical metrics\u201d that can build consumer confidence would be critical.      Senators are also likely to try to elicit the two officials\u2019 views on the $3 trillion aid bill crafted by Democrats in the House of Representatives. It narrowly passed the Democratic-controlled chamber on Friday, but is opposed by Republicans in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Before the hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.   Mnuchin also will face questions by the Senate banking panel over processing glitches that held up small-business loan applications as the Paycheck Protection Program was rushed into service in early April, as well as on abrupt policy changes that required many larger, publicly traded restaurant chains with access to capital markets to return their funds under the threat of audits.  A separate congressional oversight board issued its first report here on the response, consisting largely of questions that could be asked in Tuesday's hearing.  Among them are how the agencies will measure success and isolate the effects of the measures from other state and federal efforts.

Some businesses have expressed concerns that under the \u201cPaycheck Protection Program\u201d they have been unable to use the loan money within an eight-week time frame.   McCarthy raised the possibility of extending the time limit to 10 or 12 weeks. If borrowers meet conditions of the loans, they are converted to grants.  He said an extension would be appropriate because \u201ca number of states have been shut down longer.\u201d Representatives for the restaurant industry had pressed President Donald Trump on Monday for a 24-week repayment period.  On Friday, the House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion bill pushed by Democrats as a next step in Washington\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Its passage was expected to kick off a new round of negotiations involving the White House and Congress.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has not embraced an additional infusion of federal funding, on top of the approximately $3 trillion already enacted. Instead, he is pushing for new protections for businesses from liability lawsuits as they reopen after weeks of being shut due to the highly contagious coronavirus.  Nevertheless, a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans on Monday signed onto a bill that would establish a $500 billion fund to help state and local governments, whose revenues are being severely curtailed by the closing of the U.S. economy in March.  Some lawmakers also have discussed the need to revise unemployment insurance provisions with the national jobless rate spiking to 14.7 percent in April.

The girls were killed last week in the deeply conservative  and war-torn northwestern area of North Waziristan in what police suspect was an act of \u201chonour killing\u201d.   Police say the video which they believe prompted the girls\u2019 murder was shot a year ago but had only recently been uploaded on social media.    \u201cThe females were sisters, identified as Jasima Bibi and Saeeda Bibi,\u201d North Waziristan police chief Shafiullah Gandapur told Reuters.  Their family had been displaced by a military operation against militants in their hometown, he said.      He said the man who was filmed kissing them in a 44-second video was arrested on Monday together with a friend who police believe uploaded the video, but police believe the murder suspect fled to Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city.  Police also said the girls\u2019 father and uncle had been arrested on suspicion of concealing the murder and evidence.  The killing is the first high-profile criminal case to be pursued in the formerly autonomous tribal region, where ultra-conservative customs present a big challenge for police.  Pakistan extended police jurisdiction to the area in 2018, ending more than a century of relatively autonomous rule in a region used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to launch attacks in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan. \u00a0  Police said the girls\u2019 relatives and local residents did not want a case registered because of \u201clocal traditions\u201d, so the police became the complainant in the case.  Thousands of incidents of violence against women perceived to have \u201cdamaged\u201d family honour are reported in Pakistan each year and many more go unreported, rights groups say. Pakistan enacted legislation to protect against \u201chonour killings\u201d in 2016.

In a decision dated May 18 and seen by Reuters, the judge said the April 29 order by market regulator CENACE risked distorting free competition to the detriment of the consumer, and Mexico\u2019s commitments to promote a clean environment.  CENACE suspended the plants, arguing that the intermittency of wind and solar power threatened the reliability of the national power supply during the coronavirus crisis.  However, after several suits were filed to contest that suspension, the judge found that the risks cited by CENACE were less serious than the implications of undermining competition and jeopardizing Mexico\u2019s transition towards clean energy.  On Friday, both Canada and the European Union wrote letters to the government complaining about the CENACE\u2019s move, asking for an audience with Energy Minister Rocio Nahle. Nahle said on Monday she would respond to their concerns this week.  Late on Friday, her ministry published an order that gives the government more scope to control the process of approving new renewable energy projects, further angering those who feel the administration is squeezing out private companies.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who is intent on giving the state a bigger role in the energy sector, on Monday rejected criticism of the government\u2019s agenda.  He said he wanted to level the playing field in a sector that for too long had been beholden to private interests.  Asked for comment by Reuters, Mexico\u2019s Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece) said it was studying the orders issued by CENACE and the energy ministry, and would make a determination on them if it decided to open an investigation.

(Reuters) - When a senior living facility in Amarillo, Texas suspected a nurse may have caught the novel coronavirus this month, it had a list within five minutes of staff and residents the nurse could have infected.   High-tech wristbands worn by The Legacy at Town Square\u2019s 35 workers and 49 residents expedited contact tracing, the otherwise pain-staking process of interviewing patients to determine who crossed paths with them.   The nurse tested negative an hour later and Legacy did not have to isolate or test others. But its experience shows how wristbands and other wearables have emerged as tools to automatically record encounters between people at places that can mandate their use.  Facilities with quick contact tracing following infections in the coming months will be better positioned to ward off outbreaks and stay open, according to epidemiologists.  \u201cIt makes you ready to make the best operational decisions at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said Joseph Walter, executive director at LifeWell Senior Living\u2019s Legacy facility.  Australia, Singapore and other governments have sought to enable smartphones to record people\u2019s contacts. But data privacy rules imposed by smartphone software makers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google limit the utility of smartphone-based systems, while many employers do not let workers carry phones because of security and safety considerations.  Manufacturers are hawking wearables online priced as low as $4.    The Legacy in Texas uses technology from CarePredict, a startup that added contact tracing functionality to its system for elderly care homes when the pandemic struck.   CarePredict\u2019s Tempo bracelets function as a call button to summon staff, a digital room key, and a health and activity tracker. More than 20 care facilities in the United States have the devices, which cost about $1 per day per user, according to CarePredict.    The wristbands use infrared light to connect to beacons on a wall in each room, creating a record of who has been near whom, where and for how long.   Walter said the system has proved accurate over the last two years for tracking residents\u2019 activities at The Legacy, but its reliability in contact tracing is yet to be seen.    Setting up beacons and special-purpose devices like CarePredict\u2019s Tempo may be too costly and complex for some facilities. But wearables that communicate with each other through Bluetooth signals may be more suitable, and software development company Myplanet and automaker Ford Motor Co are among those testing popular Bluetooth-based fitness trackers and smartwatches from companies such as Fitbit Inc and Samsung Electronics Co.   One of Myplanet\u2019s experiments found that companies hoping to reduce costs and hassles by allowing workers to use existing gadgets will face connection challenges because of variances in the devices\u2019 Bluetooth technology, said Greg Fields, who is leading the Toronto-based firm\u2019s contact tracing efforts for its multinational clients.  Apple and Google soon plan to release contact tracing technology to smooth out some of the connection issues on phones, and device makers are confident that the tech giants will do the same for wearables, said David Su, CEO at Atmosic, a Silicon Valley-based wireless chip company.   The companies did not respond to requests for comment on the speculation. While Apple-Google technology would improve reliability in contact tracing, devices that use it would need access to the internet and a government-authorized contact tracing app.  Ford conducted a small test of pricey smartwatches that alert wearers when they are standing closer than guidelines allow, but they too require Wi-Fi, which is sometimes unavailable in sprawling plants, Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson told Reuters.   The automaker also is testing chips on identification badges, he said, and those could track sustained encounters or issue reminders to keep distance.

On Monday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and Mayor Bruno Covas said they were working to turn Wednesday, Thursday and Monday into holidays, with Friday a day off at the discretion of employers.  The holidays they are moving are: the Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi, normally on June 11; Consci\u00eancia Negra, a Black Awarenss holiday normally celebrated on Nov. 20, and  Constitutional Revolution Day, normally celebrated July 9.  Eleven financial industry associations, including Brazilian banking lobby Febraban, also wrote to Doria expressing concern about advancing the holidays, according to a copy of the document seen by Reuters.   The governor\u2019s office said it had not received the letter. Febraban and the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On Monday, Doria and Covas said they were taking the emergency measure to increase social isolation, pointing to data that showed more people stayed at home on recent weekends and holidays.  Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has exploded in recent weeks, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases, third-highest in the world, and nearly 17,000 fatalities. The city and state of Sao Paulo are at the epicenter, with about a quarter of the country\u2019s deaths and diagnoses.

In a sometimes testy hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the nearly $3 trillion in coronavirus rescue programs rolled out by the federal government over the past two months were working to support an economy devastated by the novel coronavirus.  But the Treasury and Fed chiefs faced tough questions over whether the administration\u2019s plans to quickly reopen the economy in the wake of lockdowns imposed in March and April would leave low-wage workers without adequate protections from the virus.  Congress is considering legislation that would free up trillions of dollars of additional aid to further bolster the economy, help states and increase pay for essential workers who are doing some of the most dangerous jobs.  President Donald Trump has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  \u201cHow many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow Jones by 1,000 points?\u201d asked Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.  \u201cNo workers should give their lives to do that, senator, and I think your characterization is unfair. We have provided enormous amounts of equipment,\u201d Mnuchin replied.  Mnuchin said he wanted to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d but Brown interrupted him, adding, \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d  Powell said new Treasury-backed Fed lending programs aimed at mid-size companies and municipal bond markets would be up and running by the beginning of June. Only a \u201cfairly modest\u201d amount of money has gone out through the Fed credit programs so far.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  Initial recipients of the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses, are nearing the end of their 8-week loan terms, and calls by senators for extensions increased during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.  Mnuchin said he hoped to reach a bipartisan agreement  \u201ctechnical fix\u201d that would extend the loans.  \u201cCompanies are really having issues with not necessarily being able to use it within those 8 weeks. They don\u2019t want more money, they want flexibility that they can use it in longer than an 8-week period,\u201d Mnuchin said.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, also pressed Mnuchin on why participants in the \u201chalf-a-trillion-dollar slush fund\u201d supporting the \u201cMain Street\u201d lending program and Fed credit facilities aimed at larger borrowers have no specific requirements to retain employees.  Mnuchin said such terms were \u201cdiscussed with people on both sides of the aisle\u201d as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was being negotiated in March.  (See graphic here showing CARES Act money flows.)  Mnuchin also said that Treasury\u2019s base-case analysis showed at least some capital losses on the Fed loan programs were expected, but that there could be instances where the Treasury earned a return on its capital. Under the most optimistic scenario, markets would fully recover and the Fed facilities would not be needed, he added.  While more than 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin also said he sees more job losses in the next month before the economy starts to improve.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Although the hearing was held by videoconference, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.

Thabane\u2019s departure marks the end of one of Lesotho\u2019s longest political careers, one marked by exile, intrigue, tensions with the military and a political crisis that deepened when police named him as a murder suspect in February.  \u201cThe time to retire from the great theatre of action, take leave from public life and office has finally arrived,\u201d the 80-year-old Thabane told citizens in a speech on Lesotho TV.

Though named as a suspect, Thabane has not been charged. They both deny any involvement.  Lawmakers have said Thabane was not offered immunity from prosecution in return for stepping down, and it remains unclear whether he will now face any charges.  Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro, named by parliament as Thabane\u2019s replacement, is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.  \u201cI plead with the entire nation... to give my successor utmost support, and for my part I wish to assure him of my support,\u201d Thabane said in his televised address.

The authorities\u2019 task to save lives was complicated by ongoing efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic and enforce social distancing to avoid a surge of infections. Many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods.  Approaching from the Bay of Bengal, super cyclone Amphan was expected to hit the coast of eastern India and southern Bangladesh with winds gusting up to 185 kmh (115 mph) - the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.  The Indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10- to 16-foot waves - as high as a two-storey house - that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.   There will be extensive damage to standing crops and plantations in the states of West Bengal and Odisha while large boats and ships could get torn from their moorings, the weather service said in a bulletin late on Tuesday.  Authorities were hastily repurposing quarantine facilities for the looming cyclone soon after easing the world\u2019s biggest lockdown against the virus, which in India is reported to have infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,163.  Railway officials diverted away from the cyclone\u2019s path a number of trains carrying thousands of migrant workers to eastern states from the capital New Delhi where they had lost their jobs due to coronavirus lockdowns.  \u201cWe have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms,\u201d disaster management official S.G. Rai told Reuters.  \u201cThe cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crops.\u201d   About 300,000 people had been moved to storm shelters, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said. The state capital Kolkata lies near the cyclone\u2019s path and there was concern about people living in about 1,500 old, dilapidated buildings.  Neighbouring Bangladesh, where the cyclone posed a devastating threat along a low-lying, marshy coast, was shifting hundreds of thousands of people to higher ground. Bangladeshi authorities were also urging use of masks against the virus, which has caused 20,995 infections and 314 deaths.  \u201cWe have taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management. He said 12,000 cyclone shelters were set up to accommodate more than 5 million people.   Bangladeshi officials said the cyclone could set off tidal waves and heavy rainfall, unleashing floods.  It was expected to hit land between the districts of Chittagong and Khulna, just 150 km (93 miles) from refugee camps housing more than a million Rohingya in flimsy shelters.  Aid workers have stockpiled emergency items such as food, tarpaulins and water purification tablets.   \u201cWe are really very worried,\u201d said Haiko Magtrayo, a worker of the International Committee of the Red Cross based in the nearby town of Cox\u2019s Bazar.

Bigger schools will open for other grades at a later date.  South Africa, the African nation worst hit by COVID-19 with 16,433 infections and 286 deaths, began a phased easing of its lockdown at the start of May.  All teachers are expected to return to work from May 25 and the revised school calendar will be published soon, the minister said, adding that school sports would not be permitted.  \u201cWhen class is dismissed, learners must go home,\u201d she said.

The British company, which employs 600,000 globally and serves daily meals to hundreds of thousands of schoolkids, office workers and prisoners, has been forced to close more than half its businesses as lockdowns took hold globally.   Its sale of 195 million new shares at 1,025 pence each was the latest move to ease pressure on its finances and came at a discount of 11.1% to Monday\u2019s closing stock market prices.   That, allied to results that showed sales down 46% in April and profits falling, knocked as much as 11% off the market value of its shares on Tuesday before a late recovery. The company is now worth more than 40% less than it was in January.  Chief Executive Dominic Blakemore told Reuters that longer periods of physical distancing, school closures and working from home threatened to reduce the number of customers Compass serves.  \u201cThe equity placing is really the last piece of the puzzle ... to give us the resilience to weather whatever this crisis looks like over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d he said.   \u201cIt may be a slightly smaller business, our job is to ensure that we\u2019ve got a profitable smaller business.\u201d  The company did nod in the direction of using the funds to invest in expansion into profitable areas at a time when smaller firms are struggling to survive, but analysts largely read the move as defensive.

The area has 581 confirmed cases and 41 coronavirus-related deaths.   The South American nation has been under a country-wide lockdown for about two months.  Ivermectin has won support among officials in Trinidad.

His confirmation vote in the full Senate is expected to be close. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans hold a 53-to-47-seat majority and rarely break from the president, but Ratcliffe has not won over Democrats.   No floor vote has been scheduled.

Trump first said he would nominate Ratcliffe, a member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to be director of national intelligence last year. The nomination did not go forward amid questions about his lack of experience and partisan reputation, but the Republican president nominated him again this year.  Senator Marco Rubio, acting chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he looked forward to voting for Ratcliffe\u2019s confirmation.  Separately, Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he had received a waiver that allowed him to remain chairman of the Senate\u2019s Small Business Committee while temporarily leading the intelligence panel.

Carissa Etienne, the head of the WHO-affiliated Pan American Health Organization, said U.S. contributions account for about 60% of the regional health agency\u2019s budget. She also pointed to successful past collaborations with the U.S. government to combat diseases like malaria and yellow fever.  However, in recent days Trump has ramped up his criticism of the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, threatening to reconsider his government\u2019s membership of the global body and to permanently end its funding.  \u201cAs the curve of the pandemic flattens or falls in other parts of the world, the virus is surging across our region,\u201d Etienne told a virtual briefing on COVID-19 in the Americas.       \u201cPAHO hopes that we will continue collaboration with the United States and all of our allies.\u201d  She said COVID-19 cases reached more than 2 million across the Americas as of Monday, with deaths standing at 121,000: \u201cThis represents a staggering increase of 14% for cases and for deaths from just last week,\u201d Etienne said.  PAHO officials voiced concern the new coronavirus was spreading rapidly in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil, which currently has the worst outbreak of any developing nation. The regional outbreak threatens to infect remote indigenous communities in the rainforest.  Etienne added there were about 20,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in Amazon provinces, and isolated villages there have minimal access to healthcare.  PAHO officials urged that special measures be taken to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.   They said the contagion was moving fast in densely populated Amazon border cities such as Manaus, Leticia and Iquitos, and the greatest danger was that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, risked spreading to indigenous villages in the forest where inhabitants had no protection.  Separately, PAHO communicable diseases director Marcos Espinal said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, after Trump said he was taking the drug despite his own government\u2019s warnings on its use.

Three scams were subjects of prior FTC enforcement actions, and the fourth was a subject of a federal criminal prosecution, the agency said.  First Data bought First Pay\u2019s merchant accounts and hired most of its staff in May 2015, and hired Ko as vice president of strategic partnerships in January 2017. He is no longer employed there.

Without one, it\u2019s unlikely economic activity can resume fully.  So the race is on, and the rewards are rich: AstraZeneca (AZN.L) has vaulted into the position of the most valuable British company after receiving a U.S. pledge for up to $1.2 billion for its experimental vaccine.  Pharma\/biotech shares have outperformed broader equities since Feb 19. Investors twitchy for vaccine news sent the share price of biotech company Moderna 20% higher when it said its vaccine trials showed promise. Rivals Novavax and Inovio also rose when they secured vaccine development funding.  The United States has vaccine development deals with Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, too. But many others, big and small, are in the race: Imperial College, Gilead Sciences, Roche, China\u2019s CanSino Biologics and India\u2019s Glenmark to name just a few.

The markets want to the see the details, however. All eyes will be on the European Commission, which on Wednesday presents its pandemic recovery plan.   The task is to ensure weaker states such as Italy can access funding without adding to their debt burden. But EU states remain divided over whether recovery funds should be funnelled through loans or transfers. If those opposed to big spending manage to water down the plan, the euro and southern European bonds will take a knock.  The change in Germany\u2019s previously hardline stance was momentous. Now it\u2019s the turn of others such as Austria and the Netherlands to decide whether they are ready to cross the Rubicon.

Opposition to Israel is a core belief for Shi\u2019ite-led Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese armed groups opposed to peace with the Jewish state, which Tehran refuses to recognize.  \u201cThe Zionist regime (Israel) is a deadly, cancerous tumor in the region. It will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed,\u201d Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in an online speech.    The United States and European Union rejected the comments.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said they were \u201ctotally unacceptable and represent a deep source of concern\u201d.  Although leaders of Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have frequently praised Iran\u2019s financial and military support, Khamenei had not himself previously given public confirmation of Tehran\u2019s weapons supply.  \u201cIran realised Palestinian fighters\u2019 only problem was lack of access to weapons.

Iranian officials have repeatedly called for an end to Israel, including by a referendum that would exclude most of its Jews while including Palestinians in the region and abroad.  Khamenei suggested global attention on the coronavirus crisis had helped obscure wrongs done to Palestinians. \u201cThe long-lasting virus of Zionists will be eliminated,\u201d he added.   Khamenei was speaking on Iran\u2019s annual Quds Day, which uses the Arabic name for Jerusalem, held on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

Delacroix, who helped modernise the mill, gave up being a magistrate in 2009 to follow her passion for baking.  \u201cI think it\u2019s been long enough (to have an impact),\u201d she said of the lockdown. \u201cI think the crisis has also brought home the importance of eating local produce,\u201d she said.  Once one of 430 mills noted in a 1900 census in the region, the Hollange mill\u2019s increased activity since March has not been without challenges. German bakers seeking scarce spelt grain on the Belgian market have sharply driven up prices.  The month of April was one of the driest and warmest on record, according to Belgium\u2019s Royal Institute of Meteorology, meaning a reduced harvest for wheat farmers and lower river water levels that could affect grinding at the mill.  \u201cIt is going to hit the harvest and, because we use hydropower, we may need to turn to electricity,\u201d Delacroix said.

He had plenty left over, and donated some of it to Helena, Texas, an 1800s ghost town that draws hundreds to historic buildings and gunfight re-enactments.  The worst oil bust in decades has slashed the bounty that flowed to millions of rural Americans like Ruckman, who said his royalty checks have plummeted 70% since January.  \u201cI imagine they\u2019re going to be dropping quite a bit more,\u201d said Ruckman, who owns the land with his brothers.  The bust has erased tens of thousands of jobs in the drilling and service sectors, dried up local tax revenues and charitable largess that flowed along with crude oil to Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.    Thanks to modern drilling technology, shale has turned the United States into the world\u2019s No. 1 energy producer, pumping as much as 13 million barrels per day (bpd) before prices crashed. It added about a percentage point to U.S. GDP between 2010 and 2015. Shale-related jobs lifted the employment rate in Texas and North Dakota to a multiple of the national average.   In DeWitt County, Texas, 80 miles (129 km) southeast of San Antonio, incomes shot up to sixth highest among the state\u2019s 254 counties at the peak of the shale boom in 2014 from 116th a decade ago, based on U.S. tax data.  Shale oil fed a global glut. OPEC and allied producers supported prices by cutting output, but this year Saudi Arabia and Russia briefly pumped more. Then fuel demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil prices are about half January\u2019s level, and many shale producers have shut wells.   U.S. output could fall about 2 million bpd this year and next, Bank of America has estimated.   (For a graphic on how shale lifted U.S. incomes, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3g75QvW)  Ruckman is among 12 million U.S. mineral owners who collect \u201cmailbox money,\u201d or payments for oil and gas extracted from their land. He declined to say how much his property drew, but residents in the heart of Texas\u2019 Eagle Ford shale got bigger royalties than many, able to negotiate richer leases because the region came later to the boom.   Royalties, which can range from 12.5% to 25% of the value of oil and gas pumped, helped revitalize DeWitt and other communities in oil patches across the United States.  John Baen, a Texas college professor who owns mineral rights in South Texas, collected as much as $100,000 a month in recent years. The payments have dwindled to $6,000 and by August, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to get anything.\u201d     The average oil-land owner collects about $500 a month, according to the National Association of Royalty Owners, but that will not last. April\u2019s price crash was so sharp, falling at one point into negative territory, that minerals holder Jubilee Royalty Holdings received a $1 check that month from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).  The shale boom paid off debt from restoring DeWitt\u2019s pink granite and sandstone courthouse and expanding the jail. Oil helped finance the area\u2019s Boys and Girls Club, which provides activities for area children.  It brought jobs that cut DeWitt\u2019s unemployment rate to 2.6% in February from 8% a decade earlier. During that time, oil and gas jobs here roughly doubled, according to the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.  (For a graphic on employment in shale regions, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3g9ppn1)  The boom enabled bookkeeper Karen Jensen Zielonka to find work managing a new restaurant in 2015 and later gave her accounting work for Cuero Oilfield Lodging, a nearby \u201cman camp\u201d for transient workers.   \u201cWhen this first happened they said it would last 25 years,\u201d said Zielonka.     But unemployment rose to 3.5% in March. Cuero Oilfield Lodging camp has been vacant since late March when shale jobs dried up, said manager Tammi Marks, who cut most of her staff.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of praying,\u201d she said.  Officials here and in other U.S. shale patches are bracing for more cuts. The value of DeWitt\u2019s mineral properties could fall this year by half, from $5.3 billion last year, county chief executive Daryl Fowler estimated.  Officials do not expect to reduce county jobs, \u201cbut it can happen,\u201d said Fowler.   In the last oil bust, from 2015-2016, DeWitt\u2019s average incomes fell 31%. That drop was short-lived, with pay rising again by 2018.   Oilfield worker Freddie Fuentes sailed through that period, without losing his job. He fears this one will sting much more.  \u201cRight now we have about five weeks of work,\u201d said Fuentes. \u201cAfter that we\u2019re done.\u201d    Some drillers hope for a turnaround. Oil prices have bounced from the April bottom when U.S. crude ended one day in negative territory. Prices now are about half January\u2019s level.   Lonestar Resources is putting oil in storage tanks that typically hold brackish water, said Chief Executive Frank Bracken, counting on a price rebound.  Still, Bracken said, \u201croyalty owners are going to see vastly diminished paychecks.\u201d    This year\u2019s crash might be much worse than recent downturns, said Amanda Weinstein, assistant professor of economics at the University of Akron, who has studied shale booms. Young people who lose jobs may \u201cfeel like there\u2019s not as much for them in that town anymore,\u201d and leave.   Williston, North Dakota, center of the Bakken shale field, was so devastated by the 1980s bust that it lagged the nation in economic growth until shale started there around 2006, Weinstein said.   At the Helena ghost town, oil royalties donated by Ruckman and others fixed a historic home whose porch had been propped up with a salvaged telephone pole. The historical society had hoped to spruce up the attraction with a visitor\u2019s pavilion and new restrooms, said Trip Ruckman, Paul Ruckman\u2019s cousin.  \u201cSome plans are on hold given the situation,\u201d he said.

The \u201chealthy tourism certificate\u201d programme aims to convince travellers that despite the global pandemic, Turkey\u2019s beaches and historic treasures will be safe to visit this year, with rigorous checks on airlines, local transport and hotels.  \u201cThe more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,\u201d Tourism Minister Mehmet Ersoy told Reuters, setting out plans to open at least half of Turkey\u2019s hotels this year.  Turkey ranks sixth globally in tourist arrivals and tourism accounts for 12% of an economy now facing its second recession in two years. Figures released on Friday showed the pandemic slashed foreign arrivals by 99% last month.   With so much at stake, the government is intensively lobbying 70 countries to convince them that Turkey will be a safe destination as it gradually eases its domestic lockdown.  The new certificates set criteria for health and hygiene in airlines, airports and other transport, as well as hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes. They will be awarded by international institutions and information will be sent to tour operators and will be accessible to tourists.  At Istanbul\u2019s Four Seasons hotel, general manager Tarek Mourad said the scheme would help reassure visitors, adding that Turkey\u2019s robust healthcare infrastructure, major new airport and far-reaching flag carrier Turkish Airlines were also assets.  \u201cIf you put all these together we create a better chance for Turkey to recover faster,\u201d Mourad said on a terrace overlooking Hagia Sophia, once Christendom\u2019s foremost cathedral and then a mosque before becoming a leading tourist attraction as a museum.  Travel company TUI said it had offers for travel from June 15. Leisure airline Corendon hopes to launch a summer package in late June, whereby Dutch holidaymakers will be tested for the virus before flying and will remain restricted to hotel grounds.  Ersoy said COVID-19 testing centres were being set up at airports.  \u201cThose guests who come without having been tested in the last 72 hours will all be tested,\u201d he said.  Passengers in terminals will be required to wear masks, and temperatures will be taken with forehead thermometers.   The project has drawn support from the tourism sector but there are worries about the level of international interest.   \u201cWe have to be realistic, this will be a slow process. The opening of 50% (of hotels) in July would be a big success in my opinion,\u201d said Erkan Yagci, chairman of the Mediterranean Touristic Hoteliers and Investors Association.   Turkish Travel Agents Association Chairman Firuz Baglikaya said the main foreign arrivals would not be until September-October, and Russia, the leading market, which sent seven million tourists last year, would start later than others.  Foreign currency earnings from tourism may fall 60-70% this year, with the domestic market halving in size, he said.  The initial test from the end of this month will be the resumption of domestic tourism, but the real prize in terms of visitor numbers and revenues is foreign tourists.  In the Mediterranean tourism hub of Antalya, domestic tourists made up less than 20% of some 100 million annual overnight stays, according to the owner of a holiday complex in the region who declined to be named.  \u201cThe rest is ... foreign visitors. Without them, there is no point in opening,\u201d he said.

Communist Party rulers in Beijing unveiled details on Friday, a day after proposing the legislation that critics see as a turning point for China\u2019s most free-wheeling city.  Pro-democracy activists and politicians in the former British colony have for years opposed such legislation, arguing it could erode its autonomy, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement under which Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.  \u201cBeijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers\u2019 critical voices with force and fear,\u201d activist Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of pro-democracy street protests in 2014, tweeted.  Some pro-democracy lawmakers denounced the plans as \u201cthe end of Hong Kong\u201d.  Hong Kong activists called for people to rise up against the proposal, aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that has sent shockwaves across the business and diplomatic communities.  Foreign diplomats fear establishing new Beijing agencies in Hong Kong could give mainland security and intelligence officers enforcement powers that could potentially put rights and freedoms, protected in the handover agreement, at risk.  Calls have emerged for flash mobs at night across the territory and democracy activists plan to meet the press to announce \u201cstreet action\u201d.  \u201cThis is a great moment to reboot the protest,\u201d said university student Kay, 24, who took part in last year\u2019s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests that entered a lull this year due to the coronavirus.  The security law plan hit financial markets on concerns the city\u2019s status as a financial hub is at risk. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index closed down 5.6%, its largest daily percentage drop since July 2015.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Chinese parliament to safeguard national security, which she said would not affect rights, freedoms or judicial independence.  The proposals could heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington, whose relationship is already frayed by trade disputes and reciprocal accusations over handling of the pandemic.  U.S. President Donald Trump warned Washington would react \u201cvery strongly\u201d if Beijing went ahead with the security law.  Pompeo said the \u201cdisastrous proposal\u201d would be the \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and that the United States stood with the people of Hong Kong.  \u201cIt is starting to look like a U.S.-China summer of discontent in the making,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp.  Innes said the new law could reignite the 2019 anti-China protests, the biggest crisis the city has faced since 1997.  In his annual report to parliament, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would establish a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms to ensure national security in Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to China in 1999.  The proposed move will see China\u2019s parliament endorse, then annex the laws into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, without any local legislative scrutiny, according to a draft seen by Reuters.  The document said the laws will safeguard the central government\u2019s \u201coverall jurisdiction\u201d as well as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201chigh autonomy\u201d given Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d.  \u201cWhen needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People\u2019s Government will set up agencies\u201d in Hong Kong to safeguard national security, the draft said.  Foreign diplomats fear this could formalise and expand the presence of mainland security and intelligence services in Hong Kong. Currently they can take no enforcement action in the city.  Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary, along with the government and legislature, must \u201ceffectively prevent, stop and punish acts endangering national security\u201d, it states. The reference to Hong Kong\u2019s staunchly independent legal system has rattled some Hong Kong lawyers.   A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people on to the streets and was eventually shelved.  \u201cIt is essentially declaring directly that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is null and a failure,\u201d said Eric Cheung, principal lecturer at Hong Kong University\u2019s department of law, of the legislation.  Beijing said the legislation would strengthen the \u201ctwo systems\u201d formula and was in Hong Kong\u2019s interest. Lam said Beijing\u2019s intention was to tackle illegal activities that had damaged national security.  Beijing\u2019s move is expected to lead to the flight of capital and talent, bankers and headhunters said.  \u201cIn some cases where clients had a bit of inertia and hoped things that happened last year will just go away, they will now step on the gas to reduce their wealth concentration risk here,\u201d said a senior banker at a European private bank.  The U.S. State Department warned a high degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory\u2019s special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre.

The drop, which Statscan called the largest on record, was led by a collapse in car sales and matched the 10% decline forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. In volume terms, sales plummeted a record 8.2%.  \u201cData for March show an ugly situation even before the economy was tamped down for a full month,\u201d said Royce Mendes, a senior economist with CIBC Capital Markets in a note.

About 40% of retailers closed their stores in March as officials urged people to stay at home, Statscan said, adding the pandemic forced many businesses to open or expand their e-commerce platforms in March. On a year-over-year basis, retail e-commerce jumped 40.4%.   Auto and parts dealership sales dropped 35.6% on lower demand, while gasoline station sales fell 19.8%, the largest decline on record, on both lower demand and lower prices as the result of a global supply glut.

Moscow\u2019s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said he expects the toll to prove much higher in May than in April. It is still much lower than many European countries with fewer cases, something that has sparked debate, but which Russia defends.    Speaking at a televised government meeting by video link, Putin said there had been a gradual decrease in the number of new infections reported daily in recent days and that the situation \u201cas a whole is stabilising\u201d.  \u201cAt the same time it is very important this decline happens against the backdrop of a constant and significant rise in the number of tests,\u201d he said.  Russia\u2019s national virus data shows a steady decline in the number of reported cases, but the Kremlin\u2019s critics and Russian media outlets have questioned the veracity of some of the figures.   A poll of 509 doctors on an app called the \u201cDoctor\u2019s Handbook\u201d cited by the Meduza news website on Thursday found that more than a third of those surveyed had been ordered to attribute pneumonia deaths caused by COVID-19 to other causes.   The health ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.    The survey found almost 40% of medical professionals said they had inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, while 23.4% said their hospitals were not ready to admit patients with suspected coronavirus infections.

Cyclone Amphan killed at least 96 people, officials said after it swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. Eighty fatalities were in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and 16 were in neighbouring Bangladesh, after winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) caused flooding, blew away roofs, uprooted trees and ripped up power lines.   \u201cThe federal and state government tried everything we could to minimise the damage from the cyclone. Still, we weren\u2019t able to save the lives of around 80 people,\u201d Prime Minister Modi told reporters on Friday at a school in the West Bengal town of Basirhat during a stop on a tour to inspect the damage.  He said India stood with the people of the affected region and announced emergency aid of 10 billion rupees ($132 million) to help West Bengal state, which is also dealing with the coronavirus epidemic.  Modi was flown over the area, surveying vast tracts of land under water, while in Kolkata, capital of West Bengal, police used drones to assess the damage from Amphan, which killed at least 19 people in the city.  The total death toll is expected to rise as communications are restored and authorities reach villages cut off by blocked roads, particularly in India\u2019s low-lying Sundarbans delta, home to 4 million people and thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat.  In the Sundarbans\u2019 Gosaba, an administrative area of the river delta that juts into the sea, the storm completely destroyed around 26,000 homes and damaged another 14,000, local disaster management official Pradip Kumar Dalui said.  The cyclone also damaged some 19 kilometres of embankments around Gosaba, causing 13 breaches that led salty water to inundate swathes of land, he said.  \u201cThe most urgent problem is the embankments. If they aren\u2019t fixed, we won\u2019t be able to save the Sundarbans,\u201d Dalui told Reuters by phone.  Sankar Halder, who runs a non-profit organisation that supports issues such as health and education in the Sundarbans, said that without temporary shelters thousands of homeless would be completely exposed to monsoon rains that will arrive in a few weeks.  The crisis could be compounded by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak as many returning migrant workers had been quarantined at home but are now forced to mix with the rest of the population, he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the scale of the disaster that awaits us,\u201d Halder said.  Modi, along with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other officials, surveyed parts of the state from an air force helicopter, looking down on acre upon acre of land swamped with flood waters, according to footage from Reuters partner ANI.  \u201cDespite this, West Bengal is fighting well. We are all with West Bengal in these adverse times,\u201d Modi told reporters at the school in Basirhat.    In Kolkata, an estimated 10,000 trees were brought down during the storm that lasted several hours and brought extensive flooding, officials said.  \u201cThe city is still in a state of shock,\u201d said Kolkata\u2019s deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, adding that municipal teams, civil defence personnel, police personnel have been working overtime to restore road connectivity.   \u201cBut there is an acute shortage of manpower due to coronavirus-related restrictions,\u201d Ghosh said, referring to a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.  Initial estimates from the Bangladesh government put the damage to infrastructure, housing, fisheries and livestock, water resources and agriculture at about 11 billion taka ($130 million).  \u201cSome 1,100 km of road, 200 bridges and 150 km of dams in coastal districts have been damaged,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, junior minister for disaster management and relief.

As people stayed indoors and brick-and-mortar stores remained shut during the health crisis, online orders surged, with the company\u2019s core commerce business rising nearly 19% to 93.87 billion yuan ($13.16 billion) in the quarter.

With China\u2019s economy starting up again much ahead of major economies in Europe and the United States, the e-commerce group said it expected to generate more than 650 billion yuan in revenue in fiscal 2021.  Alibaba has been expanding into new businesses and technologies to cope with increased competition in online shopping from smaller rivals such as JD.com Inc (JD.O) and Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O), which is popular with residents in China\u2019s lower-tier cities.  Alibaba\u2019s overall revenue rose to 114.31 billion yuan ($16.02 billion) in the quarter ended March 31 from about 93.50 billion yuan a year earlier.

Shopping malls and department stores reopened at the weekend after almost two months of closure as the number of cases slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.  The government\u2019s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) proposed the extension in response to developments with the global pandemic and to allow time to prepare for further easing at the start of next month.  \u201cThe reason for extending the emergency decree for one more month is health security, enabling a unified and continued operation by officials in a pandemic situation that has not been resolved,\u201d said CCSA spokesman Taweesin Wisanuyothin.  The extension is subject to Cabinet approval on Tuesday.  The government has extended a ban on international passenger flights, which has been in place since April, until the end of June. Schools remain closed and are scheduled to reopen in July.  Thailand has been recording daily infections in single digits for most of the past month and on Friday reported no new coronavirus infections or deaths.

The Detroit automaker, which resumed production on Monday after suspending operations in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, will launch a second shift on Monday only at its Lansing Delta Township plant. It will not immediately begin, as it had earlier hoped, second shifts on Monday at its Ft Wayne, Indiana, Flint and Silao, Mexico plants that build full-size trucks, but could resume a second shift as early as later next week, the source said.

Shares of the company, which withdrew its outlook in March due to an escalating COVID-19 pandemic, rose as much as 4% in early trading.  Deere\u2019s fresh forecast comes more than a month after President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the health crisis. The company\u2019s sales were likely to benefit from the additional liquidity, analysts have said.  \u201cDeere noted signs of stabilization (in farm equipment sales) despite the week farm sentiment,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann, adding that fiscal 2020 North American sales outlook of a decline of 10% was \u201csurprisingly benign\u201d.  The company said it expects farm and turf equipment sales to fall between 10% and 15% this year. According to Jefferies, the midpoint is better than a 14% drop estimated by analysts.  Deere typically sees a pick-up in sales of farm equipment after January as farmers start planting fields. That likely helped second-quarter demand for farm machinery hold up better than sales of construction equipment.  It forecast 2020 profit in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, down 39% to 51% from a year earlier.  In the quarter ended May 3, farm and turf machinery sales fell 18% to $5.97 billion and construction and forestry equipment sales dropped 25% to $2.26 billion.  Net income fell 41% to $666 million, or $2.11 per share in the quarter, but beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.62 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Squabbles over how to organise the ballot during the outbreak plunged Poland into political turmoil, leaving the date of the vote unclear.  Some analysts said Duda\u2019s campaign appears to have lost steam amid political infighting, with the opposition accusing the government of failing to ensure fair and free voting in its preparations for a May 10 ballot.  The ruling nationalists have pushed for the election to be held as soon as possible, wary that a growing economic downturn could erode the chances of Duda, an important ally, to be re-elected.  Government officials say June 28 is now the most likely date.  Support for Duda has fallen 20 percentage points since April, according to a May 18-19 survey by the Kantar pollster, reaching 39%. Another poll, by IBRiS, showed him at 43%.  Duda, one of Poland\u2019s most popular politicians, had polled as high as 63% shortly before the election, his popularity driven in part by an election boycott announced by the biggest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO).  A PO announcement last week to replace its candidate with popular Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski appears to have galvanised centrist voters.  A prominent defender of gay rights, a highly divisive issue in the largely conservative Poland, Trzaskowski could win 18% in the presidential ballot, securing second place, the Kantar poll showed.  Despite falling support, Duda is still likely to secure re-election, the pollster said. If he fails to win more than 50% of vote, he will have to compete with the runner up in a second round. Kantar showed him winning 48% to Trzaskowski\u2019s 41%.

President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric against China\u2019s plan for a national security law in Hong Kong on Thursday raised concerns over Washington and Beijing reneging on their phase-1 trade deal.

Mixed retail earnings from Walmart Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Home Depot Inc earlier in the week had shown online shopping gaining traction due to the stay-at-home orders.  On Friday, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its shares slipped 4.4%. Smaller rival Pinduoduo Inc\u2019s U.S.-listed shares gained 1% after posting upbeat earnings report.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell 8.4% after missing second-quarter revenue and profit estimates, hit by global lockdowns since February.  Data analytics software maker Splunk Inc rose 7.7% after saying it expects higher demand for its cloud services as people around the world take to working from home.

Capital city Bogota issued more than $150 million in 10 and 20-year paper on Thursday in a doubly over-subscribed operation.  \u201cBogota will probably be harder hit than the nation on average...that obviously means an income fall this year, an increase in spending,\u201d said city finance secretary Juan Ramirez, predicting an income fall of some 1.3 trillion pesos ($344.4 million) and a contraction of city GDP of up to 8%.

Company sources told Reuters that the appointments mean BP will be cutting its leadership positions to about 120 from 250, with many veteran executives who held key positions under former CEO Bob Dudley set to leave in the coming months.  In May 14 emails to staff seen by Reuters, Looney named over 100 so-called Tier 2 managers who will form the leadership teams of the 11 divisions he created in February to \u201creinvent\u201d BP and move away from its traditional structure of upstream and downstream units.  \u201cWe expect the reinvented bp to be smaller and nimbler. We have already started by removing a layer of management at Tier 1 and 2,\u201d Looney said in an email to staff.  BP on Friday confirmed to Reuters the management announcements detailed in the emails.   The changes mean that in many cases a whole management layer is being stripped out. For example, Starlee Sykes, who remains head of production for the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, is now two steps removed from Looney whereas before it was three.  The appointments marked Looney\u2019s first 100 days in office, which have been dominated by a collapse in oil prices due to the coronavirus pandemic that has forced energy companies to rein in costs across the board.  In April, BP cut its budget by 25% to $12 billion and said it would find $2.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2021 through the digitalization and integration of its businesses.  The London-based company, however, maintained its planned $500 million investment in renewables and low-carbon technology amid expectations of only a slow recovery in oil demand.  BP did not provide details about planned job cuts then and told the company\u2019s 70,100 employees that any reductions would be frozen for three months in the wake of the pandemic.  \u201cWe\u2019ll provide more information on the redundancy freeze in June,\u201d Looney said in his email to employees.  BP will provide details of its new long-term strategy at an event for investors in September.  For years, BP\u2019s structure has been dominated by a large oil and gas production division, known as upstream, and a refining, marketing and trading division, known as downstream - as is also the case at many major oil companies.  The new structure with 11 divisions comes into force on July 1 and is designed to help BP shift away from oil and gas towards solar and wind power and low-carbon technologies.  \u201cTogether we will work hard to build a more modern, focused and integrated company - one that is well-positioned to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead,\u201d Looney told staff.  The upstream and downstream divisions now come under one production and operations group headed by Gordon Birrell and including 14 senior managers, according to the announcement.  Among those, Andy Collins, currently head of upstream global operations, was named senior vice president production while Amber Russell, who currently heads BP\u2019s largest refinery in Whiting, Indiana, will head refining operations.   Dave Lawler will retain his role as head of BP\u2019s onshore U.S. shale operations but will also become the company\u2019s U.S. country chair, replacing Susan Dio who will retire.  The gas and low carbon group, led by Dev Sanyal, will see Felipe Arbelaez, currently Latin America regional president, become senior vice president for zero carbon energy. Louise Jacobsen Plutt will lead the hydrogen and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) business.  The customers and products group, led by Emma Delaney and which is set to lead BP\u2019s growing focus on consumers, will include 10 senior managers.  Some of the new management positions will fall under a number of the 11 groups.  For example, Lawler and David Campbell, who retains his role as head of Russia, are in both the production and operations team and William Lin\u2019s team, which aims to help cities and countries develop low-carbon energy infrastructure.  Campbell will also report directly to Looney.  High-profile departures include Michael Townsend, BP\u2019s regional president for the Middle East, and Hesham Mekawi, president for North Africa, as well as Dio.

Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday Washington has \u201clots of tools to express our displeasure.\u201d Neither he nor Pompeo detailed actions Washington might take.  \u201cThere are privileges that Hong Kong accrues because it\u2019s  considered a free system. We\u2019d have to look over whether those concessions could continue to be made,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf China moves forward and takes strong action under this new national security law ...

The ECB has already unveiled a long list of measures to mitigate recession, including 1.1 trillion euros worth of bond buys and loans at deeply negative rates. Policymakers apparently fear this may not be enough.  Arguing that a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery was unlikely as movement restrictions may be lengthy, policymakers highlighted flexibility in the bank\u2019s 750 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Scheme, its flagship bond buying scheme during the crisis.  \u201cIt (the Governing Council) was fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, and potentially its other instruments, if, in the light of information that became available before its June meeting, it judged that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed,\u201d the ECB said.  While policymakers held back on adjusting bond purchases in April, the accounts are likely to fuel speculation of a move when policymakers next meet on June 4.  Analysts polled by Reuters already expect the ECB to increase bond buy 375 million euros in June with some putting the increase as high at 750 million.  Policymakers are also likely to discuss in June whether to buy corporate bonds that recently lost their investment grade rating and speculation over so-called \u201cfallen angels\u201d may increase after ECB board member Isabel Schnabel highlighted the issue.  \u201cThe number of \u2018fallen angel\u2019 bonds was increasing, while downgrades of high-yield issuers were already much more prominent,\u201d Schnabel told policymakers, according to the minutes.

Portugal, which has so far recorded 30,200 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,289 deaths, is slowly easing restrictions in place since it locked down in mid-March.  It has been less affected than its neighbour Spain or Italy, which both plan to reopen next month.  Many shops and restaurants in Portugal have already reopened under strict restrictions as part of an effort to revive the country\u2019s export-oriented, tourism-dependent economy.  \u201cPortugal\u2019s health system responds well, and this is very important for us to be able to welcome people,\u201d Santos Silva said.  The minister\u2019s comments came a day after British low-cost airline easyJet, which operates in various Portuguese cities, said it would restart a small number of flights next month.  Earlier this month Portugal\u2019s flag carrier TAP resumed some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris.  Flights to and from outside the European Union are still temporarily suspended until June 15, with some exceptions, including some routes to and from Portuguese-speaking nations like Brazil.   The Spain-Portugal land border, which has been closed to tourists since March, will also remain shut until then.  \u201cWe are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,\u201d Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said on Friday.  The tourism industry, one of the hardest hit by the outbreak, contributed 14.6% to gross domestic product in 2018, according to the latest official data, and helped Portugal to recover from a severe debt crisis.   The sector registered a 62% slump in the number of people staying in holiday accommodation in March from a year ago and total hotel revenues fell by over 57%.  Unemployment in the Algarve region more than doubled in April compared with the same month last year as the lockdown kept foreign visitors away and wiped out seasonal jobs.

U.S. businesses oppose any change in Washington\u2019s recognition of Hong Kong as a sufficiently autonomous city, where major U.S. companies enjoy access to China and Southeast Asia, and where bilateral trade flourishes across various parts of the economy, from wine to financial services.  A new U.S. law requires the State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong, which experienced widespread protests last year over China\u2019s extradition plans, retains enough autonomy to justify favorable U.S. trading terms. President Donald Trump warned on Thursday that Washington could react \u201cvery strongly\u201d to China\u2019s new restrictions.   Here is a look at some of the consequences of a change in that status.  A revocation of the special status would cause problems for the more than 1,300 American companies with business operations in Hong Kong, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm. The State Department said 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018.  Visa-free travel access to Hong Kong could revert to strict Chinese visa rules, impeding business travel and work visa approvals.  As of 2018, the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Hong Kong stood at $82.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion that year, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Hong Kong\u2019s investment in the United States rose $3.5 billion in 2018 to $16.9 billion.  Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, civil liberties, rule of law and access to China make it attractive to international companies, and a change in that status could push some U.S. firms into costly moves elsewhere in the region.  \u201cNumerous American companies invest in Hong Kong because of its special status, its geographic location and market-based economic system,\u201d the U.S.-China Business Council said in a statement. \u201cAny change to this status quo would irreparably damage American global business interests.\u201d       Some $67 billion in annual Hong Kong-U.S. trade of goods and services could be put at risk as Hong Kong would lose its preferential lower U.S. tariff rate.    Hong Kong is treated separately from mainland China\u2019s more managed economy, and its exports to the United States are treated differently. Hong Kong has a zero tariff rate on imports of U.S. goods, which also could be at risk.  Hong Kong was the source of the largest bilateral U.S. goods trade surplus last year, at $26.1 billion, based on U.S. Census Bureau data.  According to Hong Kong\u2019s Trade and Industry Department, the former British colony in 2018 was the United States\u2019 third-largest export market for wine, its fourth-largest for beef and seventh-largest for all agricultural products.  BROADER U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS  A U.S. revocation of Hong Kong\u2019s special status would be viewed by Beijing as interfering with its sovereignty, and      China has previously threatened to \u201ctake strong countermeasures.\u201d  Eswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China department, said Hong Kong is a \u201chot-button\u201d economic and political issue for China, much like U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.    A precarious U.S.-China trade truce, already strained by Trump\u2019s anger at China over the coronavirus pandemic and a slow start to Beijing\u2019s purchases under the Phase 1 trade deal between the two countries could collapse into new tariffs and counter-sanctions, he said.    The United States also maintains export control offices and academic exchanges in Hong Kong separate from mainland China.

Speaking in an online event hosted by Swiss bank UBS, economic policy director Fabio Kanczuk gave a clear signal that Brazil is reluctant to use the extraordinary policy tools seen across much of the developed world.  Quantitative easing asset purchases, which would lower long-term interest rates, limits the market\u2019s ability to price fiscal risk at the longer end of the rates curve, Kanczuk said. This would only show up elsewhere, most likely in the currency.  \u201cIf we do QE, if we remove the (risk) premium from the curve, it will be reflected in some other financial asset, most notably the exchange rate,\u201d he said.  Brazil\u2019s real has fallen 28% against the dollar this year, with one of the main drags being interest rates falling to a record low 3.0% and expected to fall further.   Facing Brazil\u2019s biggest annual economic downturn since records began in 1900 due to the coronavirus pandemic, calls have increased for the central bank to reduce rates to the so-called \u201clower bound,\u201d effectively zero in developed economies but probably slightly higher in emerging countries.  The central bank has been granted emergency powers to buy government bonds, or conduct QE. But Kanczuk warned that QE and lower-bound interest rates would only raise inflationary pressures, weaken the currency and threaten financial stability.  \u201cQuantitative easing as a monetary policy tool is not what we have in mind. QE would distort (rates) market prices,\u201d he said.  On FX intervention, Kanczuk said the central bank is \u201cprepared\u201d and can tackle any market dysfunction by selling FX swaps or reserves.   Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said this week the bank has ample room to continue intervening if it sees fit.

But he also dashed a Silicon Valley dream: that tech workers would be able to take their generous salaries with them as they flee the Bay Area\u2019s crushing housing costs, dirty sidewalks and crowded roadways.  As lockdowns dragged into their third month, message boards popular with well-paid tech workers have lit up with fantasies of working long-term from tropical beaches and spacious houses in affordable small towns in the Midwest.  \u201cDoes that mean I could apply for a job in Silicon Valley and work remotely from, say, the Caribbean? Asking for a friend,\u201d wrote one user on Blind, an app designed to let workers swap information anonymously.  Afraid not, Zuckerberg said, addressing employees in a publicly broadcast livestream on his Facebook page.  The company, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest employers, is giving U.S. staffers who are approved to work remotely until Jan. 1, 2021 to update the company on where they plan to base themselves, at which point their salaries will be adjusted to reflect the local cost of living.  Zuckerberg said he expects half of Facebook\u2019s workforce to take him up on the offer over the next five to 10 years.  Employees who attempt to wiggle around those compensation adjustments will be subject to \u201csevere ramifications,\u201d he said, as the company needs to account for employee locations to avoid violating tax laws.  Zuckerberg said Facebook will monitor adherence by checking where employees access its VPN. Facebook also uses its own apps' to track employee locations, according to CNBC here one time using the data to find interns who failed to show up for work.  Even as many tech workers dream of a future in low-tax states, others on message boards fret about how the shift to remote work could exert downward pressure on salaries across the board and warn that being far from headquarters could steepen the climb up the corporate ladder.   One former Facebook employee, who in his 20s lived in Silicon Valley\u2019s suburbs for the short commute, said the change would open up opportunities even for employees who stay in California.  \u201cA 25-year-old maybe would rather be in San Francisco, while someone looking to raise a family might prefer to move outside the city,\u201d he said.  A Facebook spokesman said the company was not planning layoffs, compulsory moves or salary adjustments for employees who opt to stay in the Bay Area.  If the experiment is successful, Facebook\u2019s move could prompt other tech giants to compete for engineering talent by embracing remote work - and other states to compete for Californians.  \u201cThe warm, sunny states with affordable housing and zero taxes will see an influx of educated, rich workers. States will need to cut taxes to keep up,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya, the chief executive of venture capital firm Social Capital and an early executive at Facebook, said on Twitter.  The biggest loser, he predicted, would be California.

Serge Brammertz said Augustin Bizimana, who was indicted on 13 charges including genocide, murder and rape, is believed to have died in Pointe Noire, in the Republic of the Congo in 2000. His remains were identified by DNA testing.  \u201cBizimana was alleged to be responsible for the murders of former Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and 10 Belgian United Nations peacekeepers, and for the murder of Tutsi civilians\u201d in five Rwandan regions, Brammertz said in a statement.  The announcement of Bizimana\u2019s death follows the arrest in Paris last week of Felicien Kabuga, another of a handful of prominent suspects from the Rwandan genocide who had been on the run for more than two decades.  \u201cThe key lesson from the death of Augustin Bizimana is that the world should give timely justice,\u201d said Naphtal Ahishakiye, executive secretary of genocide survivors\u2019 organisation Ibuka.  \u201cThe suspects should be brought to justice before their deaths, also to avoid survivors dying before hearing the cases of those who killed their loved ones.\u201d  The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda conducted 50 trials before closing its doors in 2015. Brammertz is prosecutor of a successor U.N. court with dual offices in Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague, Netherlands, that continues to function for remaining suspects and appeals.  The statement said prosecutors had conducted DNA analysis \u201clate last year\u201d on remains that had earlier been recovered from a grave site in Pointe Noire.  \u201cSubsequent investigations and comparative DNA analysis ... over the last several months ruled out that the remains were those of any other person,\u201d it said.

Following are the key points of the plan, which varies from province-to-province. Advancing through the stages depends on factors such as the rate of infection, number of intensive care beds available, and compliance with distancing rules.   Preparatory Phase 0 (May 4-25)  - Hairdressers and other businesses that offer service by appointment reopened, professional sports leagues went back to training.  - Short walks and individual sporting activities allowed.  - From Monday, there will be no area left in this phase.  Phase 1 (from May 11)  - Gatherings of up to 10 people allowed.  - Small businesses, including shops with an area of up to 400 square metres can reopen under strict safety conditions. Only two people can be inside, or just one person if it is impossible to keep a minimum distance of 2 metres.  - Bars and restaurants can reopen their terraces with no more than 50% occupation.  - Hotels and other tourist accommodation can reopen, excluding common areas.  - Shops and other service providers must set aside preferential times for customers aged over 65 to visit.  - Places of worship are reopened, but only to one third of capacity.  - Freedom of movement increases, with people allowed to travel within the same province, as long as the whole province is in Phase 1.  - Big cities such as Madrid and Barcelona, and most of the region of Castilla y Leon will advance to this phase on Monday.   Phase 2 (May 25th)  - Theatres, cinemas, art galleries and museums can reopen, at no more than a third of their capacity.  - Places of worship can increase attendance to 50% of capacity.  - Larger shops can reopen at 40% of capacity.  - Hunting and sport-fishing will be allowed.  - Some schools will reopen, though most will stay closed until September.      - Regions comprising about half of Spain\u2019s population, including Galicia, Murcia, Extremadura, the Basque Country, as well as the Canary and Balearic islands, are progressing to this phase on Monday  Phase 3 (around the end of June)  - Restrictions on restaurants and bars will be further loosened.  - Beaches open.  - Shops can fill 50% of capacity.  - After two weeks in Phase 3, people can travel to another province if that area is also in Phase 3.

In Saudi Arabia, which lacks a codified legal system and follows Islamic law, forgiveness from a victim\u2019s family in such cases can allow for a formal pardon and a stay of execution.  The murder caused a global uproar and tarnished the image of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed he had ordered the killing.   Saudi officials denied he played a role, though in September 2019 the prince indicated some personal accountability, saying \u201cit happened under my watch\u201d.  The court which issued the five death sentences in December said the killing was not premeditated, a ruling which backed assertions by Saudi officials but which contradicted the findings of a U.N.-led inquiry into Khashoggi\u2019s killing.   Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building, and his remains have not been found.  Eleven suspects in all were put on trial in secretive proceedings in the capital Riyadh. In addition to the five sentenced to death, three were jailed and another three had the charges against them dismissed.  Khashoggi\u2019s son Salah said last December that verdict had been \u201cfair to us and that justice has been achieved.\u201d  However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations and rights groups. Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, accused Saudi Arabia of making a \u201cmockery\u201d of justice by allowing the masterminds of the 2018 killing to go free.  A Saudi prosecutor at the time said there was no evidence connecting one of those officials, Saud al-Qahtani, to the killing and dismissed charges against Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy intelligence chief.  The Saudi prosecutor had previously said that Qahtani, a former high-profile Saudi royal adviser, had discussed Khashoggi\u2019s activities before he entered the Saudi consulate with the team which went on to hill him. The prosecutor said Qahtani had acted in coordination with Asiri.   On Friday, Callamard criticised the potential pardon.   \u201cThe Saudi authorities are playing out what they hope will be the final act in their well-rehearsed parody of justice in front of an international community far too ready to be deceived,\u201d she posted on Facebook.   Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee Hatice Cengiz also condemned the pardon, tweeting: \u201cNobody has the right to pardon the killers. We will not pardon the killers nor those who ordered the killing,\u201d she said in a tweet.  Salah Khashoggi and his three siblings still live in Saudi Arabia. News reports have said the family received money and real estate from the Saudi ruling family as compensation for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. The family has denied this claim.

The Detroit automaker, which resumed production on Monday after suspending operations in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, will launch a second shift next week only at its Lansing Delta Township plant. It will not immediately begin, as it had hoped, second shifts on Monday at its Ft Wayne, Indiana, Flint and Silao, Mexico plants that build full-size trucks, but could resume a second shift as early as later next week, the source said.   GM spokesman Dan Flores said \u201cdemand for our full size picks has been very strong so we are certainly exploring ways to add production and will do that when it makes sense.\u201d  Mexican auto parts production is only this week beginning to slowly resume. GM\u2019s decision to delay resuming some production shifts shows the challenges of resuming production with thousands of suppliers.  GM shares fell 1.2% on Friday in early trading.  Last week, GM suppliers were told the company planned to resume three-shift production at it Fort Wayne plant and other plants as soon as June 1.  Sales of big Detroit brand pickups, particularly in southern and western states less affected by the coronavirus outbreak, have recently significantly outperformed the market, industry executives say.  Large pickups, including Ford\u2019s F-series line, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram, accounted for nearly 21% of all light vehicles sold in the United States in April, Ford vice president for U.S. sales, marketing and service Mark LaNeve said earlier this month.

The fast response - well ahead of many other countries facing outbreaks - was the result of merging South Korea\u2019s already advanced methods of collecting information and tracking the virus into a new data sharing system that patches together cellphone location data and credit card records.  The Epidemic Investigation Support System (EISS), introduced in late March, effectively removed technological barriers to sharing that information between authorities, by building on the country\u2019s \u2018Smart City\u2019 data system.  That platform was originally designed to let local authorities share urban planning information, from population to traffic and pollution, by uploading data in Excel spreadsheets and other formats. Now it forms the foundation for a data clearing house that has turbocharged South Korea\u2019s response to the virus.  While personal location and credit card data has been available for use by South Korean health investigators for years, previous systems required physical paperwork to request the data before it was uploaded to analytical software. That took investigators about two to three days to gather a patient\u2019s personal data to trace their contacts.\u00a0  The new system digitizes the entire process, including the requests, and can reduce that time to less than an hour, officials say. Investigators can use it to analyse transmission routes and detect likely infection hotspots.  The system has had some teething problems, and has attracted criticism on privacy grounds, but it has been a major factor in the East Asian nation of 52 million keeping virus infections at a relatively low 11,122, as of Thursday, with just 264 deaths.  It got its first test with an outbreak in May, traced to the Itaewon district of Seoul known for its nightlife, which ended up infecting at least 206 people.  \u201cFaster epidemiological survey means faster discovery of potential patients, which helps contain the spread of the virus even when there\u2019s a massive cluster of infections or people who are asymptomatic, as we\u2019ve seen in the nightclub outbreak,\u201d said Yoon Duk-hee, director for infectious disease management in Gyeonggi Province, a densely populated region near Seoul.  Yoon said she and other authorities used the EISS to trace the movements of the first person detected in the Seoul nightclub outbreak, as he visited a number of places including two nightclubs and three bars.  The system is still reliant on humans operating it to approve and upload data, which can lead to delays. And in some cases, concerns over privacy and security have led to access being so restricted that some local officials said they had to rely on old-fashioned methods.  When another infected person - a 25-year-old man known as Incheon Patient 102 - told health authorities that he did not have a job, city officials said they went to the police because the information they wanted to check was not available in a timely manner on the EISS.  The phone\u2019s location data showed he was a teacher at a private academy, where subsequent contact tracing and testing revealed at least 30 other people had been infected, including some of his students and their parents.  \u201cThere were limitations to the system,\u201d said an official at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cWe are now trying to address them after the Itaewon outbreak.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   The EISS was jointly developed by the KCDC and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, with the help of the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI). Many details of how the system works and some limitations of the programme have not previously been reported. A scientific paper on the system was published in a public health journal only on Wednesday.  Authorities\u2019 power to get information was established by a 2015 law called the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act, introduced after the country was hit by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  The law allows South Korean health officials to access a wide range of personal data, including cellphone location information and credit card transactions, without a court order.  While many countries are scrambling to develop smartphone apps that can trace the contacts of patients without revealing detailed personal information, South Korea has forged ahead with a more invasive approach.  The EISS allows an authorised investigator to log in to a secure web portal and send information requests about specific confirmed cases. Police agencies must approve requests for location data from three telecommunications operators, while the Credit Finance Association handles approval for information from 22 credit card companies.   When a request is approved, designated officials at the companies receive alerts on their phones and computers. They then upload individuals\u2019 data in an Excel spreadsheet.  The investigator then has temporary access to the information to conduct analysis. There are usually more than 10,000 location data points for each person in a typical 14-day period being analysed, according to the KCDC.  An EISS web portal seen by Reuters showed an interactive map displaying patient movements, with each location data point indicating whether it was collected via credit card or cellphone.  The government says access is restricted and authorized investigators must log in through a virtual private network (VPN) and use two-factor authentication to prevent security breaches.  Officials told Reuters that developers of the system had considered using surveillance footage and even facial recognition as part of the data the system could access, but decided against it because of privacy concerns. While CCTV is not accessed or uploaded to the EISS portal, health investigators still widely use such footage to track cases.  \u201cWe spent more time agonising over privacy than on developing the system,\u201d said Park Young-joon, a director at the KCDC.  Still, the system has raised concerns over its use of private data.  \u201cIt represents a rare non-judicial, non-consensual acquisition of location data, with no judicial oversight for the data collected,\u201d said Deborah Brown, a digital rights researcher with the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern that the door is open to abuse.\u201d  South Korean officials told Reuters that data on almost every person confirmed to have the virus is entered into the system to allow cross-referencing and analysis of likely hotspots. The KCDC declined to say how many people\u2019s data has been collected in all.  People do not have any choice whether their data is collected and accessed, but officials told Reuters that authorities notify anyone whose information is gathered and that all the data will be deleted when the virus is contained.  \u201cSuch information should only be used for crises like infectious diseases,\u201d said Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung. \u201cBut thankfully our people understand that it is inevitable in battling the pandemic.\u201d  At a national or global level, lives are more important than personal privacy, said a 64-year-old South Korean woman who asked only to be identified by her surname Jang. \u201cPersonal privacy is important, but preventing an infectious disease is even more so.\u201d  Some local health investigators said that access to the EISS has been too restricted or too slow, so they have gone back to traditional ways of requesting data.  One Incheon health official told Reuters the city did not initially use EISS on Incheon Patient 102 because it took too long to get the person registered.  Those concerns have since been addressed by changes that\u00a0will allow local agencies to register patients themselves rather than waiting for the KCDC, said Kim Jae-ho, a director at KETI.  Travel information and medical records may be added to the system, two people working on the project told Reuters. South Korean health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho said at a briefing that they are also looking at the use of Bluetooth and QR codes to log places people visit - such as nightclubs.  There was \u201can inertia in administrative process,\u201d the first KCDC official told Reuters. \u201cBut now I am swamped with calls from the local governments about how to use the system.\u201d  Reporting by Hyonhee Shin, Hyunjoo Jin and Josh Smith in Seoul; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby","84":"(Reuters) - Unemployment rates rose and total employment fell in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in April as efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close across the country, the Labor Department said on Friday.  The department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics said 43 states set record-high rates of unemployment last month, with the highest being in Nevada, the state with the greatest reliance on the hard-hit food services and hospitality industry. Nevada\u2019s jobless rate surged by 21.3 percentage points from March to 28.2%, which was nearly double the national rate of 14.7% in April.  The monthly breakdown of state-level nonfarm employment and jobless rates, published two weeks after the national payrolls report, painted a picture of widespread but nonetheless uneven devastation caused by the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness triggered by the novel coronavirus.  The May 8 payrolls report showed a record 20.5 million jobs were lost in April, the steepest plunge in U.S. employment since the Great Depression.  Friday\u2019s report indicated more than a quarter of those job losses were concentrated in three of the largest U.S. states: California, which shed 2.3 million jobs; New York, which has seen the largest number of U.S. COVID-19 cases and deaths and lost 1.8 million positions; and Texas, which has suffered a double blow from plunging oil prices and lost 1.3 million jobs.  In Nevada, home to the global gambling mecca of Las Vegas, half of the nearly 245,000 jobs lost in April were in the leisure and hospitality sector. That industry has suffered the greatest losses nationally from the reductions in travel and widespread closures of dine-in restaurants during a month when stay-at-home orders were deployed broadly.  The leisure and hospitality sector losses also took a major toll on Hawaii, which was one of only three states with an unemployment rate above 20% - Nevada and Michigan were the other two. The Pacific island state lost more than 55% of leisure and hospitality jobs last month, accounting for 57% of all jobs lost in that period.  In Michigan, more than one of every five jobs was eliminated, at least temporarily. The leisure and hospitality sector led the declines there, too, but a quarter of the state\u2019s losses came in the manufacturing and construction sectors.  Layoffs have persisted in May even as all 50 states have reopened businesses to one degree or another. On Thursday, the BLS reported more than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week and those continuing to receive jobless relief payments topped 25 million in the week ended May 9.  That data suggests the worst may not be over for the hardest-hit states such as Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. The number of continued claims rose in all three, including a 31% week-over-week increase in Hawaii.  Economists believe that progress in driving down infection rates will be an important factor behind the success of state re-opening efforts.   On that front, at least, both Hawaii and Nevada appear to be leaders, and they are among just eight states to have shown three straight weeks of declines in the 7-day average of new cases. Michigan is among 20 states that have seen declines in two of the past three weeks.

The company said it would ask its lawyers \u201cto evaluate all the actions necessary... in view of the serious damage being caused\u201d the group and to its Autostrade per l\u2019Italia unit.  Autostrade is in talks for a state-guaranteed loan worth up to 1.25 billion euros to weather the fall in motorway traffic triggered by the coronavirus crisis.  A representative of the ruling coalition 5-Star Movement, which has been pushing for Autostrade\u2019s highway concession to be revoked ever since a bridge it operated collapsed and killed 43 people, said the loan guarantee should not be given.  \u201cYou have the right to ask, and to answer is a courtesy. NO, thanks,\u201d Deputy Industry Minister Stefano Buffagni wrote in a post on Facebook on Wednesday.  While waiting for the state-backed loan, Autostrade could use a 900 million euro ($980 million) credit line granted by its parent company to cope with \u201cserious financial tensions\u201d, Atlantia said on Friday.  Rome approved a decree in April offering state guarantees on up to 400 billion euros in new bank loans.       The emergency legislation allows the Treasury to introduce additional requirements, and 5-Star wants Rome to use this option to impose draconian conditions on the company, one party source told Reuters.   It remains to be seen whether the centre-left PD party, which governs with 5-Star, will back its coalition ally in trying to block the loan.  Autostrade\u2019s executives will meet with the Treasury next week to discuss the state-backed loan, a third source said.  In addition to Autostrade, three other companies controlled by the Benettons are interested in state-backed loans, bringing the total potential requests to more than 1.8 billion euros.  Disagreement over the group\u2019s request for state-backed funds has reignited tensions with Rome over the potential revocation of it motorway concession.     Atlantia also complained the government had not yet replied to a 2.9 billion euro proposal filed by Autostrade at the start  of March to end the row over the concession.  \u201cThis situation has caused, and continues to cause, serious damage to the group as a whole and has given rise to concern among investors,\u201d it said.

According to Unica, a Brazilian sugar industry group, the decision by China\u2019s government to not renew the safeguard is the result of a negotiation between the two countries, in which Brazil canceled a request for a panel to investigate the safeguard at the World Trade Organization (WTO).  Unica said in a statement that following the expiration of the measure, Chinese import tariffs on extra-quota sugar will fall from 85% to 50%.  China also has an import quota for 1.95 million tonnes per year with a lower tariff of 15%.  The Brazilian industry group believes the end of the safeguard will boost Chinese sugar imports, particularly at a time when the Asian country seeks to guarantee food supplies amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Fuel demand plummeted as the coronavirus pandemic caused governments to impose restrictions on movement and businesses closed their doors.   Oil has rallied in recent days as activity starts to resume, but prices dropped after China said on Friday it would not publish an annual growth target for the first time. Beijing  also pledged more government spending as the pandemic kept hammering the economy.  \u201cThe coronavirus has nullified a decade of global oil demand growth and the recovery will be slow,\u201d said Stephen Brennock of broker PVM.

The deficit excluding interest payments for the Treasury, central bank and social security is more than four times wider than the 124.1 billion reais shortfall originally projected at the start of the year.  Due to the economic and public health crisis, the government was exempted from meeting that target, and the Economy Ministry\u2019s previous bimonthly revenue and expenditure report in March penciled in a deficit goal of 161.6 billion reais.  In its latest report on Friday, the ministry lowered its 2020 revenue estimate by 111.2 billion reais to 1.21 trillion reais, and raised its primary spending forecast by 267.7 bln reais to 1.75 trillion reais.  Brazil\u2019s economy is on course for its steepest annual downturn since records began in 1900. The government expects GDP to contract by 4.7%. The consensus in the central bank\u2019s latest weekly survey of economists is for a 5.1% fall.  These predictions may already look optimistic. Swiss bank UBS on Thursday became the latest in a clutch of banks to slash their GDP forecast to show a fall of 7% or more.   Using the Economy Ministry\u2019s own estimate for a 7.15 trillion reais economy this year, the 540.5 bln reais deficit would be worth around 7.5% of gross domestic product.

The Argentine ambassador to the United States wrote in a letter obtained by Reuters that the country would miss the Friday bond payments given the \u201cprospect of reaching an agreement with its creditors on new terms for their bonds.  \u201cArgentina will postpone this payment until an agreement is reached with creditors and new terms are agreed upon on the interests to be paid on said bonds,\u201d Ambassador Jorge Arg\u00fcello wrote.  Argentina\u2019s Economy Ministry said in a statement attributed to Economy Minister Martin Guzman that the interest payment was part of wider restructuring discussion \u201cand we expect it to be addressed in the broader agreement that we are pursuing.\u201d  Reuters could not immediately reach officials at the Argentine embassy in the United States for comment.  The likely default on three bonds occurs in the context of negotiations to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt with a new deadline for a deal delayed on Thursday to June 2 amid signs the two sides may be warily edging closer to an accord.  Argentina and its creditors, which have traded proposals over the last month, have indicated they are eager to avoid a messy default that could spark years of litigation and lock the major grains-producing country out of global capital markets.  Guzman told Reuters late on Thursday the government planned to amend its offer to creditors and that talks were on a positive course, though there remained an \u201cimportant distance\u201d to reach a deal.  \u201cThese are critical times. What\u2019s achieved now will affect the lives of millions of people and will likely\u00a0have spillover effects on an entire class of assets,\u201d he said.  Creditors also have shown signs of flexibility and indicated they are unlikely to take immediate action against Argentina over any default, as long as talks are on the right course.  A major creditor group holding around $16.7 billion of Argentina\u2019s international bonds said on Friday that while failure to pay would trigger defaults on various bonds, it recognized Argentina was seeking a comprehensive deal.  The Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, including names like Ashmore, BlackRock and AllianceBernstein, cautioned that it wanted more engagement from Argentina, which it said was still lacking.  \u201cThe Group welcomes Argentina\u2019s expression of an intent to work with creditors, but actions speak louder than words,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cOver the last month, Argentina has had virtually no substantive engagement with its creditors.\u201d  The Argentina Creditor Committee, another of the main groups, said on Friday it objected to Argentina\u2019s decision to default on its international bonds, though it remained committed to seeking a successful restructuring deal.  \u201cThis latest default, if not promptly resolved, will prevent access to the international capital markets needed for the recovery of the Argentine economy and therefore will be detrimental to the Argentine people.\u201d  The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Fiona Mackie, said in a note that a default would make reaching a deal even more pivotal for Argentina\u2019s economy, already stuck in recession for two years.  \u201cWithout it, Argentina faces a troubling outlook not just this year, but for several years to come,\u201d she wrote, adding that fears of losing access to credit markets would spur the government to strike a deal.  \u201cThe alternative is grim, and includes the growing risk of a hyperinflationary spiral all while economic activity remains subdued by financing constraints,\u201d she said.

The move is seen as a turning point, as leaders of the ruling Communist Party tighten control over China\u2019s freest international city, undermining its reputation as a financial hub with substantial autonomy and an independent legal system.  Greater control and a sense of security. For several years, Chinese officials have expressed increasing frustration and anger over what they see as a weak national security regime in the freewheeling city.  Last year\u2019s large and sometimes violent anti-government protests have sharpened that frustration, with China determined to thwart what it calls threats of terrorism, independence, subversion of state power, and interference by foreign forces.  China\u2019s annual session of parliament will deliberate on the plan, announced on Thursday, before it is grafted into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution without any local legislative scrutiny, as has been past practice.  In the draft of the legislation seen by Reuters, China said its move follows \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d. It said Hong Kong had failed to implement national security laws on its own as stipulated in the city\u2019s mini-constitution, under the terms of its 1997 handover from Britain.  Hong Kong lawyers are puzzled over how the imposed provisions will work in practice.  Questions include whether all protections already in the Basic Law apply and whether locally based mainland agents have enforcement power.  Another issue is whether the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress has extra powers to ultimately interpret Hong Kong court rulings on national security.  \u201cThe ground is shifting beneath our feet,\u201d one legal scholar said. \u201cThere are suddenly a lot more questions than answers. And it is not even clear whether anyone in the Hong Kong government is standing up internally against these changes.\u201d  China also said its intelligence agencies would have the right to set up offices in Hong Kong to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d. It is not clear, however, whether, they will carry out enforcement activities, a critical concern.      The issue sits at the heart of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which China agreed to protect Hong Kong\u2019s extensive freedoms, autonomy and independent legal system.  Those freedoms are protected by the Basic Law, which guides the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing.  But Article 23 of the document also says Hong Kong must \u201con its own\u201d enact laws against treason, secession, sedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets. It also seeks to outlaw ties between local and foreign political groups.  The Hong Kong government proposed such local legislation in 2003 but encountered vast opposition, with more than 500,000 people marching peacefully against it.   However the Basic Law also gives Beijing the power to annex national laws into the document - which the local government must then legislate for or effectively impose by executive fiat.   Hong Kong lawyers and politicians sometimes call this the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, but some scholars have questioned whether this power of promulgation applies to Article 23.  Yes. Britain left behind a raft of old laws covering most of the elements of Article 23, aside from subversion and secession - the act of formally withdrawing from a state.   Most are decades old and lawyers say they would be hard to deploy, given more recent protections on freedoms of speech, assembly and association written into the city\u2019s Bill of Rights and the Basic Law itself.  Highly. Given Hong Kong\u2019s protest movements and polarised politics, a fresh push even for local legislation would be tough.  Many fear that new national security legislation would prove a \u201cdead hand\u201d on the city\u2019s large and pugnacious press and rich artistic traditions, while curbing its broad political debates.    Any step by Beijing to impose its own version via promulgation risks panic and chaos, many observers believe, potentially sparking a flight of people and capital and denting Hong Kong\u2019s international financial role.  \u201cAny effort to impose draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong would be inconsistent with Beijing\u2019s promises, and would impact American interests there,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late in April.

Communist Party rulers in Beijing on Friday unveiled details of the legislation that critics see as a turning point for the former British colony, which enjoys many freedoms, including an independent legal system and right to protest, not allowed on the mainland.  Pro-democracy activists and politicians have for years opposed such legislation, arguing it could erode its autonomy, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement under which Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.  \u201cBeijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers\u2019 critical voices with force and fear,\u201d activist Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of pro-democracy street protests in 2014, tweeted.  Hong Kong activists called for people to rise up against the proposal, aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that has sent shockwaves across the business and diplomatic communities.  Foreign diplomats fear establishing new Beijing agencies in Hong Kong could give mainland security and intelligence officers enforcement powers.  \u201cThis is a great moment to reboot the protest,\u201d said university student Kay, 24, who took part in last year\u2019s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing unrest, with protesters angry at perceived meddling by China with Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, a charge Beijing denies.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Chinese parliament to safeguard national security, which she said would not affect rights, freedoms or judicial independence.

U.S. President Donald Trump warned Washington would react \u201cvery strongly\u201d if Beijing went ahead with the security law.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the \u201cdisastrous proposal\u201d would be the \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and that the United States stood with the people of Hong Kong.  \u201cThe United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,\u201d he said.  Hong Kong\u2019s last colonial governor, Chris Patten, told Channel 4 television that party rulers in Beijing were a \u201cfrightened lot of bullies\u201d.  \u201cYou cannot trust (President) Xi Jinping\u2019s China.

He cannot abide anyone who disagrees with him and the Chinese government.\u201d  Britain expects China to respect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said.  In his annual report to parliament, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would establish a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms to ensure national security in Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to China in 1999.  The proposed move will see China\u2019s parliament endorse, then annex the laws into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, without any local legislative scrutiny, according to a draft seen by Reuters.  The document said the laws will safeguard the central government\u2019s \u201coverall jurisdiction\u201d as well as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201chigh autonomy\u201d given Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d.  \u201cWhen needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People\u2019s Government will set up agencies\u201d in Hong Kong to safeguard national security, the draft said.  Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary, along with the government and legislature, must \u201ceffectively prevent, stop and punish acts endangering national security\u201d, it states. The reference to Hong Kong\u2019s staunchly independent legal system has rattled some Hong Kong lawyers.   A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people on to the streets and was eventually shelved.  \u201cIt is essentially declaring directly that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is null and a failure,\u201d said Eric Cheung, principal lecturer at Hong Kong University\u2019s department of law, of the legislation.  Beijing said the legislation would strengthen the \u201ctwo systems\u201d formula and was in Hong Kong\u2019s interest.

At least 56 people were confirmed to have died, hospital officials told Reuters, though other officials gave different figures and authorities did not release an estimate of casualties on the ground.  Two passengers survived, including Zafar Masood, president of the Bank of Punjab, a Sindh provincial government spokesman said. The bank said he had suffered fractures but was \u201cconscious and responding well\u201d.   The other survivor, engineer Muhammad Zubair, told Geo News the pilot came down for one landing, briefly touched down, then took off again.   After around 10 more minutes of flying, the pilot announced to passengers he was going to go around for a second go, then crashed as he approached the runway, Zubair said from his bed in Civil Hospital Karachi.  \u201cAll I could see around was smoke and fire,\u201d he added. \u201cI could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn\u2019t see any people \u2013 just hear their screams.  \u201cI opened my seat belt and saw some light \u2013 I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10 feet to get to safety.\u201d  Smoke billowed from the scene where flight PK 8303 came down at about 2:45 p.m. (0945 GMT). Twisted fuselage lay in the rubble of multi-storey buildings as ambulances rushed through chaotic crowds.  The crash happened on the eve of the Muslim festival of Eid, when Pakistanis travel to visit relatives.          \u201cThe aeroplane first hit a mobile tower and crashed over houses,\u201d witness Shakeel Ahmed said near the site, a few kilometres short of the airport.  The Airbus A320 was flying from the eastern city of Lahore to Karachi in the south with 91 passengers and eight crew, civil aviation authorities said, just as Pakistan was resuming domestic flights in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.      A total of 56 bodies were brought to JPMC hospital and the Civil Hospital Karachi, officials from both institutions said. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Arshad Malik, told reporters he knew of 41 confirmed deaths.  Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic controllers he had lost power from both engines, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net, a widely respected aviation monitoring website.  \u201cWe are returning back, sir, we have lost engines,\u201d a man was heard saying in a recording released by the website. The controller freed up both the airport\u2019s runways but moments later the man called \u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday!\u201d.  There was no further communication from the plane, according to the tape, which could not immediately be authenticated.  \u201cThe last we heard from the pilot was that he has some technical problem ... It is a very tragic incident,\u201d said the state carrier\u2019s spokesman, Abdullah H. Khan.  Another senior civil aviation official told Reuters it appeared the plane had been unable to lower its undercarriage for the first approach due to a technical fault, but it was too early to determine the cause.  Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes, and that it is too early to understand them within the first hours or days.  Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted: \u201cShocked & saddened by the PIA crash ...  Immediate inquiry will be instituted. Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased.\u201d   Airbus said the jet first flew in 2004 and was fitted with engines built by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and France\u2019s Safran.

Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) also said on Friday it had sent a preliminary decision to Facebook-owned WhatsApp for their submissions and made further progress in three other investigations related to Facebook.  Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms, making the DPC the EU\u2019s lead regulator under the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s (GDPR) \u201cOne Stop Shop\u201d regime introduced in 2018.

Each of the bloc\u2019s regulators may be called on for a majority decision if agreement cannot be reached.  The DPC is not commenting on the substance of the preliminary Twitter decision at this point, Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle told Reuters.  The Twitter ruling relates to a 2019 probe into a bug in its Android app, where some users\u2019 protected tweets were made public. Twitter is the subject of two of the 20 other inquiries the DPC had open into big tech firms at the end of 2019.  Facebook has come under most scrutiny, with eight individual probes, plus two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.  The DPC said it had moved to the decision-making phase of a complaint-based inquiry which focuses on Facebook Ireland\u2019s obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing.   It said it had also sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned in two further inquiries concerning Instagram and WhatsApp.  Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Mark Potter","102":"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Malta on Friday rescued a group of 140 migrants from a sinking dinghy but refused to bring them to land, holding them instead on a chartered tourist harbour cruise boat just outside territorial waters.  The rescue was conducted by a Maltese patrol boat in the early hours of Friday after the dinghy drifted into Malta\u2019s search and rescue region.   The migrants were transferred to the tourist boat on Friday afternoon. They join another two tourist boats chartered for the same purpose by the government just over two weeks ago and holding another 160 migrants.  The government has insisted it will not allow any migrants to land in Malta, saying other European Union nations have not kept promises to take migrants already brought to the island.   Prime Minister Robert Abela has also told the European Union than once Malta\u2019s airport and harbours have been closed to tourists, they will not be open to migrants.  The government confirmed on Friday, however, that a group of 19 including children, their parents and pregnant women who had been among the newly rescued migrants have been brought to Malta for humanitarian reasons.  Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo in a statement on Thursday said Malta\u2019s migration centres are holding twice the number of people they were designed for and Malta was at the mercy of people smugglers.  \u201cWe want to protect the rights of people seeking protection, but we can only do so much. We are being left alone. Words of sympathy are not enough, we need practical help,\u201d he said referring to the EU.   Only 8% of migrant arrivals had been distributed to the EU over the years, he said. Of 1,500 this year, only France and Portugal had pledged to take migrants, just 36. Malta, he said, was protecting an EU external border, but \u201cwe cannot become European Union\u2019s crisis centre.\u201d  He warned that the situation in Libya was worsening and the migration problem, therefore, was likely to also worsen over the coming months.   On May 8 Malta pressed its demand for EU migration action by warning that it will vote to freeze financing for a naval mission monitoring arms traffic into Libya.  It also told the EU that it would no longer commit a landing party to form part of the mission, known as Operation Irini.

The default on three bonds came as negotiations to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt revved up, with Economy Minister Martin Guzman saying talks were on a positive course despite an \u201cimportance distance\u201d left to reach a deal.  A source close to the talks and familiar with the government\u2019s thinking separately told Reuters that the two sides were making substantial progress and that a comprehensive deal was possible in a \u201cmatter of days, not months\u201d.  Argentina and its creditors, which have traded proposals over the last month, have indicated they are eager to avoid a messy default that could spark years of litigation and lock the major grains-producing country out of global capital markets.  The country has pushed the deadline for a deal to June 2 amid signs the two sides may be edging closer to an accord.  The default could however complicate things.  \u201cArgentina today failed to pay $503 million in interest which was originally due on April 22,\u201d Gabriel Torres, a Moody\u2019s vice president said in a statement, adding it was consistent with the agency\u2019s current sovereign credit view on the country.  \u201cWe expect the road ahead for Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring is likely to become more problematic.\u201d  Argentina\u2019s ambassador to the United States had earlier written in a letter obtained by Reuters that the country would miss the Friday payments given the \u201cprospect of reaching an agreement with its creditors on new terms for their bonds.\u201d  Guzman said in a statement the interest payment was part of wider restructuring discussion \u201cand we expect it to be addressed in the broader agreement that we are pursuing.\u201d  The minister told Reuters late on Thursday the government planned to amend its offer to creditors based on negotiations over the coming days.   \u201cThese are critical times. What\u2019s achieved now will affect the lives of millions of people and will likely\u00a0have spillover effects on an entire class of assets,\u201d he said.  Creditors also have shown signs of flexibility and indicated they are unlikely to take immediate action against Argentina over any default, as long as talks are on the right course.  A major creditor group holding around $16.7 billion of Argentina\u2019s international bonds said that while failure to pay would trigger defaults on various bonds, it recognized Argentina was seeking a comprehensive deal.  The Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, including names like Ashmore, BlackRock and AllianceBernstein, cautioned that it wanted more engagement from Argentina, which it said was still lacking.  \u201cThe Group welcomes Argentina\u2019s expression of an intent to work with creditors, but actions speak louder than words,\u201d it said. \u201cOver the last month, Argentina has had virtually no substantive engagement with its creditors.\u201d  The Argentina Creditor Committee, another of the main groups, said it objected to Argentina\u2019s decision to default on its international bonds, though it remained committed to seeking a successful restructuring deal.  \u201cThis latest default, if not promptly resolved, will prevent access to the international capital markets needed for the recovery of the Argentine economy and therefore will be detrimental to the Argentine people.\u201d  The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Fiona Mackie, said in a note that a default would make reaching a deal even more pivotal for Argentina\u2019s economy, already stuck in recession for two years.  \u201cWithout it, Argentina faces a troubling outlook not just this year, but for several years to come,\u201d she wrote, adding that fears of losing access to credit markets would spur the government to strike a deal.  \u201cThe alternative is grim, and includes the growing risk of a hyperinflationary spiral all while economic activity remains subdued by financing constraints,\u201d she said.

Those who breached the quarantine in England could be fined 1,000 pounds ($1,218), and spot checks would be carried out by health and border officials.

[nL8N2D44UM]  Transport minister Grant Shapps has also suggested the government would seek to negotiate \u201cair bridges\u201d for travellers coming from countries with low virus infection rates.  Unlike many other countries, Britain has carried out few tests and checks on visitors, with quarantine limited only to arrivals from China at the start of the outbreak.

Below are details of the scheme:  Everyone arriving in the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days except those on a list of \u201climited exemptions\u201d, which the government said it would publish later.   Those exempt will include:  - road haulage and freight workers  - medical professionals who are travelling to help with the fight against the coronavirus  - anyone moving from within the Common Travel Area, which covers Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man  - Seasonal agricultural workers will be able to self-isolate on the property where they are working  The government said it would also continue to look at the option of things such as air bridges - agreements between countries who both have low transmission rates to remove the need for quarantine measures.  All arriving passengers will have to fill in an online contact form providing details and travel information so they can be contacted if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops the disease.  This will include giving details of their self-isolation accommodation and if it does not meet the necessary requirements, they will be required to self-isolate in facilities arranged by the government, at the passenger\u2019s expense.  The government said people should use personal transport, such as a car, to travel to their accommodation where possible.  Once there, they should not go to work, school, or public areas, or use public transport or taxis. They should not have visitors, including friends and family, unless they are providing essential support.  They should also not go out to buy food or other essentials where they can rely on others.  The new regime will be in place across the United Kingdom, although enforcement measures will be set individually by each of the devolved nations.  In England, a breach of the self-isolation rules would be punishable with a 1,000 pound fine or potential prosecution and unlimited fine. The level of fine could increase if the risk of infection from abroad increases.     Border Force may refuse entry to any non-British citizen who refuses to comply with these regulations and is not resident in the UK.  Failure to complete the contact form is punishable by a 100 pound fine. The government said public health authorities would conduct random checks in England to ensure compliance and  removal from the country would be considered as a last resort for foreign nationals who refuse to follow the rules.  The rules will come into force on June 8 and will be reviewed every three weeks.  The government said that as the rate of infection in the United Kingdom falls and the number of travellers arriving in the country begins to increase, imported cases could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and risk a second wave of the virus.

The omission from Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s work report marks the first time China has not set a target for gross domestic product (GDP) since the government began publishing such goals in 1990.   The economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction in decades, hit by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.   \u201cWe have not set a specific target for economic growth for the year, mainly because the global epidemic situation and economic and trade situation are very uncertain, and China\u2019s development is facing some unpredictable factors,\u201d Li said at the start of parliament.   Domestic consumption, investment and exports are falling, and the pressure on employment is rising significantly, while financial risks are mounting, he warned.   China has set a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year, according to Li\u2019s report, down from a goal of at least 11 million in 2019 and the lowest since 2013.   Ahead of the National People\u2019s Congress, the week-long meeting of the largely rubber-stamp parliament, China\u2019s top leaders have promised to boost stimulus to bolster the economy amid rising worries job losses could threaten social stability.   Beijing is also planning security legislation for Hong Kong, which Li said will provide a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms but which critics say could curb autonomy in the city.   The move drew warnings from the United States, falls on Asian stock markets and calls among Hong Kong activists for protests in the former British colony.  China is targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year\u2019s 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan ($527 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan, according to Li.  The government will issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds this year, the first such issuance. It will transfer 2 trillion yuan raised from the bigger 2020 budget deficit and special anti-coronavirus treasury bonds to local governments, Li said.  Local government bonds could be used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the outbreak.   The fiscal stimulus in Li\u2019s report is equivalent to about 4.1% of China\u2019s GDP, according to Reuters calculations based on the fiscal measures announced.  \u201cThe annual budget points to fiscal stimulus this year at least on par with that following the global financial crisis,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.  But Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, said Li\u2019s report indicates China will \u201cnot resort to mass stimulus that some market players have been betting on.\u201d  Nie expects GDP growth to slow sharply this year to around 2% or 3% from last year\u2019s 6.1%.   \u201cThis year\u2019s economic growth needs to reach around 3% to create 9 million new urban jobs,\u201d Nie said, adding that the size of the fiscal stimulus announced by Li is about 4 trillion yuan.   In line with the slower economy, China will raise defence spending by 6.6% this year, the slowest in three decades, while the budget for environmental protection will increase a modest 4%.  Monetary policy will be more flexible, Li said, adding that growth in M2 - a broad gauge of money supply - and total social financing will be significantly higher this year.   The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will guide its benchmark lending rate lower, he said.   The central bank has cut the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 46 basis points since August 2019, when it replaced the previous benchmark lending rate. The one-year LPR rate is now 3.85%.  The PBOC has cut reserve requirement ratios 10 times since early 2018, including three cuts this year.  Small and midsize companies can delay paying loans and interest by a further nine months, through March 2021, and lending to SMEs by big commercial banks should grow more than 40%, Li said.

The blacklisting marked the latest effort by the Trump administration to crack down on companies with ties to military purchases and to punish Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities. It came as Communist Party rulers in Beijing on Friday unveiled details of a plan to impose national security laws on Hong Kong.  The Commerce Department said it was sanctioning nine companies and institutions on grounds they were \u201ccomplicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs\u201d and others.  The government cited seven commercial entities for enabling China\u2019s high-technology surveillance. The Commerce Department also added 24 governmental and commercial organizations to the economic list for supporting procurement of items for use by the Chinese military.  Among the companies named is NetPosa (300367.SZ), one of China\u2019s most famous AI companies, whose facial recognition subsidiary is linked to the surveillance of Muslims in the country\u2019s far west. It once harbored hopes of selling its technology in the United States.  Qihoo 360, a major cybersecurity firm in China whose research is widely followed by security professionals, was also added.  The Commerce Department said it was adding the firms to its \u201centity list\u201d which bars the companies and organizations from access to U.S. technology without specific U.S. government approval.   Softbank-backed CloudMinds was also added. It operates a cloud-based service to run robots such as a version of Pepper, a humanoid robot capable of simple communication. The company was blocked last year from transferring technology or technical information from its U.S. unit to its offices in Beijing, Reuters reported in March.  A CloudMinds representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The new listings follow a similar October 2019 action when Commerce added 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including some of China\u2019s top artificial intelligence startups and video surveillance company Hikvision (002415.SZ) - to a U.S. trade blacklist over the treatment of Uighur Muslims.  The actions follow the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons.

President Donald Trump\u2019s warning on Thursday that the U.S. would react strongly to China\u2019s plan for a national security law in Hong Kong has raised concerns over Washington and Beijing\u2019s possibly reneging on their Phase 1 trade deal.  Late in the session, stocks edged lower after the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding 33 Chinese companies and other institutions to an economic blacklist for human rights violations and to address U.S. national security concerns.  The increasing rhetoric between Washington and Beijing has knocked Wall Street off multi-month highs, although the three main indexes still all rose around 3% for the week, fueled by optimism about an eventual coronavirus vaccine and the easing of virus-related curbs.   \u201cWe still think COVID-19 concerns are in the driver\u2019s seat, but we could see U.S.-China relations move back into the front seat,\u201d said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

Prosecutors said William Sadleir, 66, diverted much of the $1.7 million of loans he received on May 1 from the Paycheck Protection Program for personal expenses.  He allegedly did this after falsely telling JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the Small Business Administration the funds were meant for his former company Aviron Group, which had terminated him in December and where he has no current role.  The PPP was meant \u201cto help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain,\u201d U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said in a statement.  Sadleir was also accused of having previously induced the closed-end BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Fund (BIT.N) to invest $75 million in Aviron to support its films.  Prosecutors said he then created a sham company to conceal his use of the money, and assumed the fake identity \u201cAmanda Stevens\u201d to communicate by email with the BlackRock fund about its investment.

Businesses and citizens \u201cneed to know that we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is rooted in science, evidence and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks,\u201d Trudeau said.

Canada\u2019s total cases rose to 81,765 on Friday, and deaths were up less than 2% to 6,180, official data showed.   With contagion slowing, provinces have been gradually reopening in recent weeks.   On Friday, Quebec said museums, libraries and drive-in movie theaters can open from May 29.

The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.  Trump wants to \u201cremove or change\u201d a provision of a law known as section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.  Trump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation \u201cimmediately\u201d to regulate social media companies.  On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House\u2019s plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation.  \u201cWhat I think we can say is we\u2019re going to regulate it,\u201d Trump said before the signing of the order.  \u201cI\u2019ve been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,\u201d said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November.  Twitter did not comment on the executive order. A Google spokeswoman said \u201cundermining Section 230 in this way would hurt America\u2019s economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.\u201d  A Facebook spokesman said repealing or limiting the provision will restrict more speech online and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.  Trump\u2019s remarks and the order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230. It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him.  \u201cIn terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,\u201d said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.  Others like Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor said \u201cThe president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him.\u201d   Twitter\u2019s shares ended over 4 percent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 percent and Google parent Alphabet Inc finished slightly up.  Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to  promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats. He and his supporters have leveled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump\u2019s presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle.  On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his Twitter account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers.  The protections of Section 230 have often been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations.   Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services.  Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company\u2019s website late Wednesday that the president\u2019s tweets \u201cmay mislead people into thinking they don\u2019t need to register to get a ballot. Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\u201d   On Wednesday evening, Twitter continued to add fact-checking labels and \u2018manipulated media\u2019 labels on hundreds of tweets.  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump\u2019s planned order \u201coutrageous\u201d and a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the coronavirus crisis.  Steve DelBianco, president of NetChoice, a trade group that counts Twitter, Facebook and Google among its members, said the executive order \u201cis trampling the First Amendment by threatening the fundamental free speech rights of social media platforms.\u201d  Under the order, the Commerce Department has 60 days to petition the FCC to adopt new rules and then the agency will review the petition. It could take anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the FCC to propose and adopt final rules.     Federal spending on online advertising will also be reviewed by U.S. government agencies to ensure there are no speech restrictions by a company.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained the lockdown ordered on March 25 to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world\u2019s second most populous country, though many restrictions were eased for manufacturing, transport and other services from May 18.

In the latest dispute between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, the U.S. government has signaled plans to punish Beijing for proceeding with a national security law for Hong Kong that critics fear would erode the city\u2019s freedoms.  All eyes are now on Friday\u2019s press conference hosted by Trump where he will address his response to China over its treatment of Hong Kong.  It is not clear if Trump will rescind some, none, or all of the U.S. economic privileges that Hong Kong enjoys under U.S. law. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said on Thursday Hong Kong may now need to be treated like China on trade and other financial matters, which could have implications for tariffs and stock market listings.  \u201cRisk appetite quickly disappeared after President Trump announced he would address China tomorrow at a press conference.\u00a0It didn\u2019t take much to help traders rush to exits,\u201d Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at currency trader Oanda, wrote in a note.  If tensions between China and the United States intensify, a build-up of short positions in the S&P 500 index, or bets that the index will fall, could spark a sell-off in shares, Moya added.  Stock markets have rebounded from lows hit in mid-March on hopes that enormous government stimulus could help the world economy recover more quickly than expected from the coronavirus shutdown. Some analysts have warned, however, that such optimism is misplaced given the extent of economic devastation.  Indeed, the latest U.S. data showed the economy may be stabilising, but at a much lower level.

Economy Minister Martin Guzman said the offer from the Ad Hoc Bondholder Group and a second group of bondholders to revamp around $65 billion in bonds was a positive step but \u201cstill fell short, insufficient for the needs of the country.\u201d  \u201cThe result is that we have come closer but there is still an important way to go,\u201d Guzman said, echoing a statement made earlier to Reuters.  Argentina and its creditors are locked in a new round of talks about restructuring billions of dollars of debt, which the South American country says it is unable to pay without getting substantial relief. The major grains producer last week failed to make around $500 million of bond payments, marking its ninth sovereign default.  Creditors rejected a government offer in April, while subsequent counterproposals from bondholders were knocked back as not giving the country enough breathing room as it grapples with a biting recession.  Both sides have struck a more conciliatory tone in recent weeks, despite the default, raising hopes for a deal to help avoid a messy legal standoff that could drag on for years.  In a separate statement, the government said it had presented creditors a \"revised debt proposal\" during talks, bringing maturities on most of the new bonds in its original offer one year earlier and improving the coupon payments for some bonds, which in many cases would start in 2022. [Link: here]  The Ad Hoc group, which includes names like BlackRock, AllianceBernstein and Ashmore, said earlier that its latest  proposal offered Argentina more favourable terms, including more than $36 billion of front-loaded cash flow relief over a nine-year period.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement that Peru had achieved impressive macroeconomic outcomes given its \u201cvery strong policy and institutional frameworks,\u201d but remained vulnerable to external risks such as a prolonged coronavirus outbreak.  The world\u2019s second-largest copper producer has reported 135,905 infections of the new coronavirus and 3,983 deaths.   The IMF\u2019s Flexible Credit Line was established in 2009 to prevent crises, giving countries with very strong track records the flexibility to draw funds at any time during the period of the arrangement. Disbursements are not phased nor conditioned on compliance with policy targets as in traditional IMF programs.  Georgieva said Peru\u2019s low inflation and prudent fiscal management had been instrumental in lowering government debt and building fiscal buffers, while effective financial sector supervision had contributed to preserving financial stability.  She said Peruvian authorities had responded to the pandemic with containment measures and a large policy package to limit the socio-economic fallout, but a prolonged outbreak could disrupt trade and financial flows.  The new IMF arrangement would serve as temporary insurance and should buttress confidence at a time of heightened global uncertainties, the IMF leader said.  She added that Peru intended the credit arrangement to be precautionary, and would reduce access and consider exiting the arrangement when external risks to the economy had subsided.

The statement came as U.S. President Donald Trump is due to announce later on Friday his response to the Chinese parliament\u2019s advancement of national security legislation for Hong Kong, which democracy activists and Western countries fear could erode the city\u2019s freedoms.  The former British colony enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  \u201cAny sanctions are a double-edged sword that will not only harm the interests of Hong Kong but also significantly those of the U.S.,\u201d the city\u2019s government said late on Thursday.   It added that from 2009 to 2018, the U.S. trade surplus with Hong Kong was the biggest among all its trading partners, totalling $297 billion of merchandise and 1,300 U.S. firms are based in the city.  Beijing says the new legislation will tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city. It could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases there.  The plan has ignited the first big protests in Hong Kong for months, as thousands of people took to the streets this week, prompting police to fire pepper pellets in the heart of the city\u2019s financial district to disperse crowds.  The U.S. Department of State said in a report on Thursday it could \u201cno longer certify that Hong Kong continues to warrant (differential) treatment\u201d from Beijing.  Trump\u2019s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned that Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special privileges under U.S. law based on its high degree of autonomy from Beijing, may now need to be treated like China on trade and other financial matters.  In a separate statement on Friday, published in several local newspapers, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam urged \u201cfellow citizens\u201d to \u201cjoin hands to pursue our dreams while putting aside our differences\u201d.  She said the legislation was needed because of a \u201cterrorist threat\u201d and because organisations advocating \u201cindependence and self-determination\u201d have challenged the authority of Beijing and local governments and pleaded for foreign interference.  The five demands of last-year\u2019s pro-democracy protest movement included universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police handling of the protests, but not independence. A minority of protesters waved \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d flags.  Independence is anathema for Beijing.  The security legislation, along with a bill to criminalise disrespect for China\u2019s national anthem, are seen by protesters as the latest attempt by Beijing to tighten its control on the city.  The security legislation, expected to be enacted before September, was condemned also by Britain, Australia, Canada and others. Britain said it will give greater visa rights to British national overseas passport holders from Hong Kong unless China suspends its plans.

China says the new legislation will aim to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city. But the plan, unveiled in Beijing last week, triggered the first big protests in Hong Kong for months.   Thursday\u2019s move was quickly condemned by the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic adviser warned that Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special privileges under U.S. law based on its autonomy from Beijing, may now need to be treated like China when it comes to trade and other financial matters.  \u201cWe can\u2019t let this go unnoticed and they will be held accountable for that,\u201d Larry Kudlow told CNBC.

Under congressional legislation Trump signed last year, it now falls to him to decide to end some, all or none of the U.S. economic privileges Hong Kong enjoys.  Trump offered a muted response to Hong Kong\u2019s mass democracy protests last year while prioritizing a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping that Trump saw as important for his November re-election bid. But ties with Beijing have since soured considerably.  Chinese authorities and Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed government say there is no threat to the city\u2019s autonomy, but critics say the security legislation will erode the high degree of autonomy the former British colony has enjoyed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.  Riot police were out in force in Hong Kong on Thursday as its lawmakers debated a bill to criminalise disrespect of China\u2019s national anthem. Dozens of protesters chanted slogans in a shopping mall, but there was no repeat of disturbances the previous day when police made 360 arrests.  In Beijing, members of China\u2019s mostly rubberstamp parliament burst into prolonged applause when a tally showed 2,878 votes to one in favour of moving forward with security legislation, with six abstentions.  Details of the law, which could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the city, are expected to be drawn up in coming weeks. It is expected to be enacted before September.    Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said it would be good for Hong Kong\u2019s long-term stability and prosperity and the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula would remain a national policy.  Beijing\u2019s move comes as U.S.-China tensions have worsened amid mutual recriminations over the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China but has hit the United States hardest.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday Hong Kong no longer warranted special treatment under U.S. law, given the erosion of autonomy in the territory.  But it is far from clear that Trump will be prepared to take what analysts have called the nuclear option and completely end the special economic status Washington has conferred on Hong Kong since the end of British rule.  U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions said the administration was crafting a range of options, including targeted sanctions, new tariffs and further restrictions on Chinese companies.  Two sources told Reuters on Thursday that Washington was also planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students. {nL8N2DA4FT]  Trump\u2019s actions may be tempered by concern for the more than 1,300 U.S. companies that have offices in Hong Kong and provide about 100,000 jobs.

Wang\u2019s real passion is rock music.  Known by his stage name, Ghost, he is the front man of Zhong-D-Yin, whose songs tell of the lives of workers in crowded dormitories, loneliness, romance and risking injuries.   \u201cI don\u2019t think about my role in life when on stage,\u201d said Wang, 33. \u201cFor example, you open a restaurant and you are a chef. In the family, you are a son. I think my joy comes from the moment on the stage, when I can feel I am myself.\u201d  The five-member band, based in Shenzhen\u2019s industrial Henggang area, an hour\u2019s drive from downtown, started nine years ago when a charity project involving its current drummer taught factory workers to play instruments.   Zhong-D-Yin, whose name puns on the Chinese for \u201csubwoofer\u201d and \u201cheavy grassroots music,\u201d has made its mission to document the life and culture of migrant labour as it is pushed out from the city. Economic pressures and rising land prices have led many factories to move inland or to Southeast Asia over the last eight years, the band said.   The coronavirus has sped that up, with many of Henggang\u2019s migrant workers giving up on returning to Shenzhen after lockdowns kept them away.  \u201cThe virus impact was huge,\u201d Wang says, frying noodles over a roaring flame in the cramped kitchen of his restaurant. \u201cNot so many people are working here now. Unless things change, maybe the restaurant will survive another two months.\u201d   The dip in business has forced him to take a job at a small cardboard box factory, but even there, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s just not enough work to go around.\u201d   Shenzhen grew quickly in from its rural roots in the 1980s into a gleaming symbol of China\u2019s emergence as a global economic power.   But with Shenzhen\u2019s government focused on next-generation industries, and some of China\u2019s highest property prices, lower-end manufacturers are being pushed out.  \u201cTen years ago this area was all factories or dusty plots,\u201d Wang says on the 10-minute walk from the noodle shop to the band\u2019s practise studio.   \u201cNow there\u2019s a subway, a highway, fancy malls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now an apartment costs 3,200 yuan a month. A factory salary is 5,000 yuan a month. Life\u2019s becoming impossible for workers.\u201d  It is even harder in the aftermath of the coronavirus.  A since-retracted report from brokerage Zhongtai Securities last month said the virus could have cost about 70 million jobs, implying an unemployment rate of 20.5%, far above the official 5.9% rate for March.  And Guangdong province\u2019s total foreign trade totalled 1.92 trillion yuan between January and April, down 9.9% year-on-year, official data showed.   The decline of Shenzhen\u2019s migrant worker culture makes Zhong-D-Yin\u2019s mission more timely, says bass player Huang Xiaona, 34.   Huang, a social worker, is the only member of the band without a factory background.   \u201cThe grass is growing out (at the factories)\uff0cthere are no more machines running ... but we want to record the memories of workers, write down our own history and have our own voice about what life was like here,\u201d she said.

The killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, who died when a white officer pinned him down with a knee to the neck, and Breonna Taylor, shot in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment, raise questions as to whether police were engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and the other Democratic members told Attorney General William Barr in a letter.  The letter also asks the department to probe the local law enforcement authorities who were responsible for investigating the death of Ahmaud Arbery, another unarmed black man who was gunned down by a former police officer and his son while jogging in his Georgia neighborhood.  \u201cPublic trust in the blind administration of justice is being seriously tested by recent high-profile killings of African-Americans,\u201d Nadler wrote.  The deaths of Floyd, Arbery and Taylor have garnered national attention and civil rights advocates say they are the latest in a long history of racially motivated attacks against unarmed black men and women by white police or perpetrators.  The death of Floyd, 46, sparked sometimes violent protests this week, after video showing him gasping for air while a policeman kneeled on his neck went viral. It echoed the 2014 death of Eric Garner in New York, which helped fuel the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Lopez Obrador drew parallels with Argentina, saying governments preceding his leftist ally President Alberto Fernandez had unduly indebted the South American nation and that banks and funds would now have to absorb losses there.  In its ninth sovereign default, Argentina missed payments on around $500 million in already delayed bond coupons last Friday, and its government has been negotiating for more favorable terms on $65 billion of outstanding debt.

The yuan pulled away from a record low in offshore trade, but investors remain nervous ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement later on Friday of policy moves that could ignite a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.  The greenback was on course for a weekly loss against major currencies as progress in lifting coronavirus lockdowns and stimulus plans in Europe weakened demand for safe havens, but the mood could quickly worsen if Sino-U.S. tensions increase.  \u201cAt the moment, hopes for economic recovery are strong, but I expect this to gradually fade to increased concern about the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.  \u201cWhen that happens, there will be more risk-off trades, which supports buying of both the dollar and the yen.\u201d  The dollar stood at $1.1073 per euro in Asia on Friday, close to its lowest since March 30.  The common currency was headed for its second weekly gain against the greenback as the EU\u2019s announcement of a 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuelled optimism about the euro-zone economy.

The Australian dollar bought $0.6630, close to its highest in more than two months, while the New Zealand dollar traded at $0.6204, near its strongest since March 11.  The Aussie and the kiwi were on course for weekly gains as investors cheered the gradual re-opening of business activity in the two antipodean economies.  China\u2019s parliament on Thursday approved national security legislation for Hong Kong that Western countries fear could erode the city\u2019s freedoms.  Trump, who has vowed a tough U.S. response, told reporters he would hold a news conference on China on Friday.  The risk is Hong Kong could lose some of the special privileges in enjoys under U.S. law, which would threaten its status as a global financial hub.  The potential stand-off has stirred memories of last year\u2019s bruising Sino-U.S. trade war, which weighed on the global economy and roiled financial markets.  Offshore, the yuan traded at 7.1725 per dollar, near a record low of 7.1966 reached on Thursday.  Investors will closely watch the opening of the onshore yuan and moves in Chinese stocks to gauge market sentiment before Trump\u2019s announcement.  This week the euro led the charge against a weakened dollar after EU policymakers unveiled fiscal stimulus combining grants and loans intended to ease dissent among euro-zone countries.  Analysts say the euro may struggle to extend its gains, because fiscally conservative member states may still push to alter the plan.  Some traders will focus on the release of German retail sales and EU consumer prices later on Friday to measure the health of the euro-zone economy.  Elsewhere, the pound held steady at $1.2317. Sterling was on course for its second weekly gain, supported by broad selling in the dollar this week.  However, sentiment for the pound has been somewhat negative due to calls for the resignation of an influential aide to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, lack of progress in EU trade talks, and speculation about negative interest rates.

Global activity ground to a halt in April as government-imposed lockdowns due to the pandemic disrupted supply chains and led consumers to postpone many purchases, putting a damper on the outlook for the world\u2019s third-largest economy.  Official data on Friday showed factory output slipped 9.1% in April from the previous month, the biggest drop since comparable data became available in 2013 as automakers and iron and steel manufacturers suffered sharp output declines due to weak global demand.  That was a much larger decline than the 5.1% drop in a Reuters forecast.  Separate data showed retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace since March 1998 as the nationwide state of emergency led service-sector businesses such as restaurants to close and encouraged consumers to stay home.  Retail sales plunged 13.7% in April from a year earlier, heavily weighed by slumping demand for general merchandise and clothing as well as motor vehicles.  The gloomy data comes after Japan\u2019s export-reliant economy fell into recession for the first time in 4-1\/2 years in the first quarter.  The government this week lifted the state of emergency and approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package, bringing the total pledged to save the economy from the pandemic to $2.2 trillion, or about 40% of gross domestic product (GDP).  Japan was already trying to shake off weak demand before the outbreak after the government raised the nationwide sales tax to repair its public debt burden, which is more than twice the size of GDP.  Other government data on Friday further highlighted the widening hit to the jobs market from the outbreak.  The April jobless rate rose to 2.6%, its highest since December 2017, while the number of non-regular workers posted the biggest year-on-year drop on record.  Job availability slipped to 1.32, its lowest since March 2016.

Meat processors like Tyson Foods, WH Group\u2019s (0288.HK) Smithfield Foods and JBS USA temporarily closed about 20 slaughterhouses last month as workers fell ill with the new coronavirus, leading to shortages of certain products in grocery stores. Production remains lower than normal because of increased absenteeism and social distancing among employees.  An Iowa state official said 555 employees at Tyson\u2019s Storm Lake plant tested positive for the virus, about 22% of the workforce.  Tyson will stop slaughtering hogs at the facility and finish processing the animals over the next two days, according to a statement.   It will resume operations next week following \u201cadditional deep cleaning and sanitizing of the entire facility,\u201d the statement said. The closure is due partly to a delay in COVID-19 testing results and employee absences, according to Tyson.  Tyson said it conducted large-scale COVID-19 testing at the plant in northwestern Iowa and implemented safety measures to protect employees like requiring them to wear masks.  The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union called on the Trump administration and meat companies to do more to protect workers. The union reported more than 3,000 infections and 44 deaths among U.S. meatpacking workers, up from 35 deaths as of May 12.  \u201cToo many workers are being sent back into meatpacking plants without adequate protections in place, reigniting more outbreaks in the plants and our communities,\u201d said Nick Nemec, a South Dakota farmer who is part of an advocacy group working with the union.

U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said the nearly 1,300 plaintiffs, including many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, plausibly alleged that the banks conspired to rig currency benchmarks from 2003 to 2013 and profit at their expense.  \u201cThis is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,\u201d Schofield wrote in a 40-page decision.  The banks, which sometimes controlled more than 90% of the market, included Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered and UBS or various affiliates.  In their complaint, the plaintiffs accused the banks of improperly sharing confidential orders and trading positions, and using chat rooms with such names as \u201cThe Cartel,\u201d \u201cThe Mafia\u201d and \u201cThe Bandits\u2019 Club.\u201d  Banks were also accused of using deceptive trading tactics such as \u201cfront running,\u201d \u201cbanging the close\u201d and \u201ctaking out the filth.\u201d  The banks countered that the plaintiffs pointed to no transactions where the alleged manipulation caused losses.  Schofield dismissed portions of some the claims, and dismissed some Allianz plaintiffs from the case.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The litigation began in November 2018, after the plaintiffs \u201copted out\u201d of similar nationwide litigation that had resulted in $2.31 billion of settlements with most of the banks.

Economy Minister Martin Guzman said in a statement progress was being made in crunch talks ahead of a June 2 deadline, but there was work left to do to strike a deal to avert a messy legal standoff that could drag on for years.  He added that an offer from the Ad Hoc Bondholder Group and a second group of bondholders was a positive step but \u201cstill fell short, insufficient for the needs of the country.\u201d  \u201cThe result is that we have come closer but there is still an important way to go,\u201d Guzman said, echoing a statement made earlier to Reuters.  Argentina and its creditors are locked in a new round of talks about restructuring billions of dollars of debt, which the South American country says it is unable to pay without getting substantial relief. The major grains producer last week failed to make around $500 million of bond payments, marking its ninth sovereign default.  Creditors rejected a government offer in April, while subsequent counter-proposals from bondholders were knocked back as not giving the country enough breathing room as it grapples with a biting recession.  Both sides have struck a more conciliatory tone in recent weeks, despite the default.  In a separate statement, the government said it had presented creditors a \u201crevised debt proposal\u201d during talks, which would see coupon payments restart in 2022 on most bonds, earlier than a 2023 target in its original offer.  The revisions here would also bring maturities on most of the new bonds one year earlier than initially proposed and improve the coupon payments for some bonds.   The Ad Hoc group, which includes names like BlackRock, AllianceBernstein and Ashmore, said earlier its latest proposal offered Argentina more favorable terms, including more than $36 billion of front-loaded cash flow relief over a nine-year period.   Ad Hoc said the proposal, made jointly with the Exchange Bondholder Group, which holds $4 billion of Argentina\u2019s so-called \u201cexchange bonds\u201d, had the support of the country\u2019s \u201clargest creditor constituencies.\u201d The group did not provide further details of the offer.  Guzman said the government hoped to keep working with the Ad Hoc group, but added it was currently the \u201cfurthest away\u201d from meeting the country\u2019s requirements.  \u201cThere are other creditors with whom we have traveled a path that brings us closer,\u201d he said.

The yuan fell in onshore trade and remained near a record low in offshore trade as markets turned nervous before Trump\u2019s announcement later on Friday of policy moves that could ignite a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.  The greenback was on course for a weekly loss against major currencies as progress in lifting coronavirus lockdowns and stimulus plans in Europe weakened demand for safe havens, but the mood could quickly worsen if Sino-U.S. tensions increase.  \u201cAt the moment, hopes for economic recovery are strong, but I expect this to gradually fade to increased concern about the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.  \u201cWhen that happens, there will be more risk-off trades, which supports buying of both the dollar and the yen.\u201d  The dollar stood at $1.1083 per euro in Asia on Friday, close to its lowest since March 30.  The common currency was headed for its second weekly gain against the greenback as the EU\u2019s announcement of a 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuelled optimism about the euro-zone economy.  The dollar last bought 0.9632 Swiss francs, on course for a 0.8% weekly decline.  The greenback was little changed at 107.43 yen.   The Australian dollar bought $0.6630, close to its highest in more than two months, while the New Zealand dollar traded at $0.6204, near its strongest since March 11.  The Aussie and the kiwi were on course for weekly gains as investors cheered the gradual re-opening of business activity in the two antipodean economies.  Japan\u2019s currency crept higher against the euro, the Aussie and the kiwi, supported by safe-haven flows in relatively subdued trade.  China\u2019s parliament on Thursday approved national security legislation for Hong Kong that Western countries fear could erode the city\u2019s freedoms.  Trump, who has vowed a tough U.S. response, told reporters he would hold a news conference on China on Friday.  The risk is Hong Kong could lose some of the special privileges in enjoys under U.S. law, which would threaten its status as a global financial hub.  The potential stand-off has stirred memories of last year\u2019s bruising Sino-U.S. trade war, which weighed on the global economy and roiled financial markets.  In the onshore market, the yuan edged lower to 7.1515 against the dollar. Offshore, the yuan traded at 7.1674, not far from a record low of 7.1966 reached on Thursday.  This week the euro led the charge against a weakened dollar after EU policymakers unveiled fiscal stimulus combining grants and loans intended to ease dissent among euro-zone countries.  Analysts say the euro may struggle to extend its gains, because fiscally conservative member states may still push to alter the plan.  Some traders will focus on the release of German retail sales and EU consumer prices later on Friday to measure the health of the euro-zone economy.  Elsewhere, the pound held steady at $1.2327. Sterling was on course for its second weekly gain, supported by broad selling in the dollar this week.  However, sentiment for the pound has been somewhat negative due to calls for the resignation of an influential aide to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, lack of progress in EU trade talks, and speculation about negative interest rates.

China\u2019s parliament on Thursday pressed ahead with national security legislation for the city, raising fears over the future of its democratic freedoms and function as a finance hub.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed a tough response, said he will hold a news conference on China later on Friday. Trepidation about a further deterioration in Sino-U.S. relations sent stocks lower and put investors on edge.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. The Nikkei .N225 retreated from a three-month high and, though moves were slight, riskier currencies were under pressure against the U.S. dollar.  Futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.7%.   \u201cIt is seen as a major threat to the rally we\u2019ve had and the recovery,\u201d said Shane Oliver, chief economist at Australian wealth manager AMP Capital.  The possible U.S. response could range from a tearing up of the Phase 1 trade deal and fresh tariffs on China, to milder travel or financial sanctions on Chinese officials, he said.  \u201cIf it\u2019s at the relatively mild end, then I don\u2019t think it would derail the recovery bull market, but if it\u2019s at the more extreme end with tariffs and harsh treatment of Hong Kong, then I think it gets more problematic,\u201d Oliver said.  Trump offered a muted response to Hong Kong\u2019s mass democracy protests last year while prioritising a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But ties with Beijing have since soured considerably through the COVID-19 pandemic.  Hong Kong\u2019s government warned on Friday that withdrawing its special U.S. status, which has underpinned it as a finance hub, could be a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d and urged the United States to stop interfering in internal affairs.  The Chinese yuan CNY=, a barometer of Sino-U.S. tension, weakened slightly to 7.1490 per dollar in onshore trade.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index .HSI was 0.4% lower in early trade and has lost 3% in the two weeks since news of China's security legislation broke.      Still, despite the gathering tension and the near-daily release of diabolical economic data, enormous global stimulus seems to have dispelled the old adage to \u201csell in May\u201d.  The S&P 500 .SPX is up 4% for the month and is on track for its best May since 2009. The rally in the risk-sensitive Aussie dollar AUD=D3 is slowing, but the currency has gained nearly 2% for the month and sits 20% above March lows.  The reason for optimism stems from signs of progress away from the presently parlous state of the world economy.  The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell for an eighth straight week last week and New York has outlined plans for reopening.  \u201cAs we have said about the reopening and ensuing recovery, this is a process,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets\u2019 chief U.S. economist, Tom Porcelli. \u201cAnd right now the process is moving along in the right direction.\u201d  Elsewhere the euro remained firm and headed for its best month since December as the European Union\u2019s announcement of a 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuels optimism about the euro-zone economy and its political future.  The euro EUR= was last at $1.0855, close to a two-month high of $1.1094 hit overnight.  Gold was firm at $1,720.75 an ounce.

The move is seen as a turning point, as leaders of the ruling Communist Party tighten control over China\u2019s freest international city, undermining its reputation as a financial hub with substantial autonomy and an independent legal system.  U.S. reaction was swift, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling Congress that Hong Kong no longer qualified for special status under U.S. law, potentially dealing a crushing blow to its status as a global financial centre.  Greater control and a sense of security. For several years, Chinese officials have expressed increasing frustration and anger over what they see as a weak national security regime in the city.  Last year\u2019s large and sometimes violent anti-government protests have sharpened that frustration, with China determined to thwart what it calls threats of terrorism, independence, subversion of state power, and interference by foreign forces.  Having been approved by parliament, the legislation will be grafted into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution without any local legislative scrutiny, as has been past practice.   Details of the law are expected to be drawn up in coming weeks. It is expected to be enacted before September.  China says Hong Kong has failed to implement national security laws on its own as stipulated in the city\u2019s mini-constitution under the terms of its 1997 handover from Britain.  Hong Kong lawyers are puzzled over how the imposed provisions will work in practice.  Questions include whether all protections already in the Basic Law apply and whether locally based mainland agents have enforcement power.  Another issue is whether the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress has extra powers to ultimately interpret Hong Kong court rulings on national security.  \u201cThere are suddenly a lot more questions than answers and it is not even clear whether anyone in the Hong Kong government is standing up internally against these changes,\u201d one legal scholar said.   China also said its intelligence agencies would have the right to set up offices in Hong Kong to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d. It is not clear, however, whether they will carry out enforcement activities, a critical concern.   The issue sits at the heart of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which China agreed to protect Hong Kong\u2019s extensive freedoms, its high degree of autonomy and its independent legal system until 2047.  Those freedoms are protected by the Basic Law, which guides the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing.  But Article 23 of the document also says Hong Kong must \u201con its own\u201d enact laws against treason, secession, sedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets. It also seeks to outlaw ties between local and foreign political groups.  The Hong Kong government proposed such local legislation in 2003 but encountered vast opposition, with more than 500,000 people marching peacefully against it.   However the Basic Law also gives Beijing the power to annex national laws into the document - which the Hong Kong government must then legislate for or effectively impose by executive fiat.   Hong Kong lawyers and politicians sometimes call this the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, but some scholars have questioned whether this power of promulgation applies to Article 23.  Yes. Britain left behind a raft of old laws covering most of the elements of Article 23, aside from subversion and secession - the act of formally withdrawing from a state.   Most are decades old and lawyers say they would be hard to deploy, given more recent protections on freedoms of speech, assembly and association written into the city\u2019s Bill of Rights and the Basic Law itself.  Highly. Given Hong Kong\u2019s protest movements and polarised politics, a fresh push even for local legislation would be tough.  Many fear that new national security legislation would prove a \u201cdead hand\u201d on the city\u2019s large and pugnacious press and rich artistic traditions, while curbing its broad political debates.    Any step by Beijing to impose its own version via promulgation risks panic and chaos, many observers believe, potentially sparking a flight of people and capital and denting Hong Kong\u2019s international financial role.

They don\u2019t stop until the lone volunteer fielding calls from hundreds of people yearning to talk signs out early the next morning.   Both operating days and volunteer numbers at the volunteer-run Tokyo Befrienders call centre have been cut to avoid coronavirus infection, but the desperate need remains.  \u201cThere are so many people who want to connect and talk to somebody, but the fact is we can\u2019t answer all of them,\u201d centre director Machiko Nakayama told Reuters.  Health workers fear the pandemic\u2019s economic shock will return Japan to 14 dark years from 1998 when more than 30,000 people took their lives annually. With the grim distinction of the highest suicide rate among G7 nations, Japan adopted legal and corporate changes that helped lower the toll to just over 20,000 last year.  Worried the current crisis will reverse that downward trend, frontline workers are urging the government to boost both fiscal aid and practical support.   \u201cWe need to take steps now, before the deaths begin,\u201d said Hisao Sato, head of an NGO that provides counseling and economic advice in Akita, a northern prefecture long known for Japan\u2019s worst suicide rate.  National suicides fell 20% year-on-year in April, the first month of the country\u2019s soft lockdown, but experts said that was likely due to an internationally recognised phenomenon in which suicides decrease during crises, only to rise afterwards.  \u201cIt\u2019s the quiet before the storm, but the clouds are upon us,\u201d Sato said.   Prevention workers see echoes of 1998 when a sales tax hike and the Asian economic crisis first drove annual suicides above 30,000, then to a peak of almost 34,500 in 2003.   Economic circumstance is the second biggest reason for suicides, behind health, according to 2019 police data, which also shows that men are nearly three times more likely to kill themselves than women, and most are in the 40-60 age group.  The current crisis, which is forecast to shrink Japan\u2019s economy 22.2 percent this quarter, is especially dangerous for cash-strapped small and medium-sized businesses for whom government subsidies might not arrive in time.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough. A lot of people are really worried,\u201d said Shinnosuke Hirose, chief executive of a small human resources firm that has lost nearly 90% of its business. \u201cIt\u2019s like waiting at the execution grounds to see if they survive or not.\u201d  A Health Ministry official in charge of suicide policy told Reuters his department planned to ask for more money from a $1.1 trillion central government stimulus package to help fund measures such as extra hotlines. The official, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the record, added there were limits to central government action and local efforts were crucial.  Some believe the steps taken in recent years to bring down the suicide rate will hold firm through the current crisis, but others are not so sure.  Kyoto University\u2019s Resilience Research Unit has predicted 2,400 more suicides for each 1% rise in unemployment. If the virus subsides in a year, unemployment could peak at around 6% by March, lifting annual suicides to around 34,000, it estimated. If pandemic conditions persist for two years, a rise to 8% unemployment by March 2022 would see suicides spike over 39,000.  \u201cOf course social support is important ... but they won\u2019t be able to ramp this up suddenly,\u201d said unit director Satoshi Fujii. \u201cPreventing bankruptcies will start helping immediately.\u201d  At the Tokyo Befrienders call centre, the phones continue to ring.

Since defaulting for the first time on its foreign currency debt in March, Lebanon has formed a rescue plan and started negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on $10 billion of aid, both moves that would normally be read as positive for a country mired in debt.  But the country\u2019s $31 billion of sovereign dollar-bonds have generally rallied only a few cents in the last two months and are languishing at around 17 cents in the dollar. This is much lower than bonds of Argentina and Ecuador, two other distressed names in the throes of overhauling their debt and far below the average recovery value from emerging markets sovereign defaults at 69 cents.  Lebanon may be looking at a recovery value of only a third of that level, analysts said, citing references in the rescue plan of \u201csignificant\u201d expected losses for foreign holders of Eurobonds.  One emerging markets veteran said he hadn\u2019t seen a country face such dire straits in his lifetime.  \u201cIts nothing like Ecuador or Argentina,\u201d said the creditor, who holds a small amount of the paper. \u201cLebanon will take a very long time to resolve. It faces four different crises: balance of payments crisis, debt crisis, bank crisis, political crisis and all are linked.\u201d  For years, Lebanon\u2019s economy was sustained through overseas diaspora capital funnelled from the banks to fund a government beset by state waste, corruption and bad governance. But that system collapsed when the flow of money dried up and anti-government protesters took to the streets in October last year, leaving the state facing a gaping balance of payments hole, a debt-to-GDP ratio of 176% and a $20.6 billion wipe out in banks\u2019 shareholder capital.  And while consensus gradually appears to be building between banks, which are among the state\u2019s biggest creditors, and the government on a rescue plan, concerns linger about the appetite of a government dominated by sectarian power-brokers and former warlords to push through painful reforms expected to be demanded by the IMF.  Another foreign creditor highlighted what they saw as a discrepancy in the plan related to future balance of payments financing requirements, seemingly indicating the government was not facing up to the scale of the challenge.  Lebanon\u2019s bonds were valued at 14 cents in the dollar at an auction last month to determine the payout on credit default swaps (CDS), tools used to price the risk of a default by a borrower. That was lower than many other sovereign CDS auctions in recent years, including troubled Venezuela which priced at 24.5 cents in December 2017. With little sign of progress on the debt restructuring there, those bonds have sagged to less than 10 cents.  Lebanon\u2019s CDS auction should not be relied upon as an infallible guide to eventual debt restructuring levels, Bank of America said in a research note. Though given that the government\u2019s rescue plan included a nominal face-value cut to Eurobonds of 75%, recovery values would be below 20 cents, the bank added.   \u201cKeeping to the very low coupon rate they (the government)talked of and keeping it as a bullet bond for now... the weaker exchange rate would bring the base case recovery down to somewhere in the low 20s,\u201d said Nick Eisinger, principal, fixed income emerging markets at Vanguard, which holds a small amount of Lebanese debt.  Lebanon\u2019s restructuring comes at a time of heightened stress in emerging markets in the wake of the devastation left by COVID-19.   Also hit by the oil price plunge, Ecuador last month struck a deal with the holders of nearly $20 billion in sovereign bonds to delay interest payments, while Zambia applied for financial help from the IMF and picked French company Lazard Freres to advise it on its debt. Sri Lanka is also under strain.   Opportunities elsewhere and Lebanon\u2019s particular challenges means some fund managers, including distressed debt traders, who might normally eye a bargain at this level have so far been reluctant to step in.  The volume of trading of the Eurobonds surged to $3.9 billion in March, but fell back by more than two-thirds of that amount in April and further still in May after it engaged with the IMF and drew up a rescue plan, MarketAxess data shows.  Allianz Global Investors was looking more at emerging markets with a strong oil sector or export base that might be facing temporary issues, said Giulia Pellegrini, senior portfolio manager at Allianz. Lebanon has neither.  \u201cIts a more complex story and that\u2019s why people have been taking it with a pinch of salt instead of being more excited as you\u2019re trading around the 20 area and there\u2019s room for higher recovery values if you think about the average EM experience,\u201d she said.  Ashmore Group, one of the largest holders of the foreign debt, has declined to comment on Lebanon. But it has previously suggested there was potential for higher recovery when sovereign debt was trading at such distressed levels, particularly as some governments might be worried about being cut adrift from debt capital markets in future.

The bad numbers suggest the recession seen in the world\u2019s third-largest economy over the six months to March is likely to deepen in the current quarter as government-imposed lockdowns disrupted supply chains and kept consumers shut in at home.  Official data on Friday showed factory output slipped 9.1% in April from the previous month, the biggest drop since comparable data became available in 2013 as automakers and iron and steel manufacturers suffered sharp declines.  That was a much larger decline than the 5.1% drop in a Reuters forecast.  \u201cOutput will probably pick up from June onwards but it will be necessary to remain on guard for a second wave (of coronavirus infections),\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.  \u201cThe pace of a rebound will likely continue to be sluggish.\u201d  Automaker production fell by a third from the previous month. That led the government to downgrade its description of overall production to \u201cdecreasing rapidly\u201d for the first time since November 2008, from just \u201cdecreasing\u201d previously.  \u201cConditions among manufacturers particularly in the auto sector are severe, but production has already restarted in China and I think that they will be resumed in the United States and Europe as well,\u201d said Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura after the release of the data.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201.T) plans to slash production capacity and model range by about a fifth to help cut costs by 300 billion yen ($2.79 billion), following a slide in sales, the automaker said on Thursday.  Separate data showed retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace since March 1998 as the nationwide state of emergency led service-sector businesses such as restaurants to close.  Retail sales plunged 13.7% in April from a year earlier, heavily weighed by slumping demand for general merchandise, clothing and vehicles.  The gloomy data comes after Japan\u2019s export-reliant economy fell into recession for the first time in 4-1\/2 years in the first quarter.  The government this week lifted the state of emergency and approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package, bringing the total pledged to save the economy from the pandemic to $2.2 trillion.  Japan was already trying to shake off weak demand before the outbreak after the government raised the nationwide sales tax to repair its public debt burden.  The largest component of the government\u2019s new stimulus package was a loans programme for smaller firms in immediate need of cash to keep the lights on.  Other government data on Friday showed worsening conditions in the jobs market, suggesting such support for small- and mid-sized firms remained much-needed to reduce the risk of employment conditions worsening.  The April jobless rate rose to 2.6%, its highest since December 2017, although still well-off the rates seen in other developed nations, where unemployment is approaching depression-era levels.  The number of non-regular workers posted the biggest year-on-year drop on record. Job availability slipped to 1.32, its lowest since March 2016.  Analysts said jobs pain is mostly concentrated in the service sector as opposed to automakers, which were hit badly during the 2009 global financial crisis.  \u201cIf demand around cars doesn\u2019t recover, there\u2019s a possibility employment conditions in the manufacturing sector will worsen more going forward,\u201d Minami said.  The factory output data showed manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall another 4.1% in May, followed by a 3.9% rise in June.

The 1.6 billion yen amount includes basic pay and other compensation, a group filing showed.  The figure was second only to renumeration for SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, which rose 17% to 2.1 billion yen.     While offering big pay packets to foreign executives, compensation for CEO Masayoshi Son was 209 million yen, a 9% decline compared to a year earlier.    SoftBank\u2019s massive annual operating loss was largely due an $18 billion shortfall at the Saudi-backed Vision Fund which has seen investments in startups like office sharing firm WeWork and ride-hailing app operator Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) flounder.  A key architect of the disastrous WeWork investment, vice chairman Ron Fisher who was the group\u2019s most highly paid executive in the previous business year, saw his renumeration slashed 80% to 680 million yen. COO Claure has become WeWork\u2019s executive chairman as SoftBank restructures the company.  Son told an earnings presentation in May that tech unicorns had plunged into the \u201cvalley of the coronavirus\u201d but a smaller number of the tech companies would make it.

Thousands of businesses have begun to reopen in the Andean country, with new safety protocols and reduced staff, as a lockdown in place since late March was due to lift at the end of May.  Under the government-mandated extension, that business restart will continue. Hairdressers and barbers are among the businesses allowed to reopen, along with museums and libraries, at the discretion of local mayors.   However, other broad restrictions will remain in place. Public transit between municipalities and domestic flights will remain barred and in many areas people are required to stay indoors.   Colombia has reported more than 25,300 COVID-19 cases and 882 deaths. The rate of new cases reported daily continues to rise, with the 1,268 confirmed new cases on Wednesday the biggest daily surge so far.  Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez had already announced plans to extend movement restrictions in the capital until at least June 15. Bogota accounts for more than 8,500 of the country\u2019s reported infections.  \u201cWe have agreed with the health ministry to follow these recommendations in Bogota for the next two weeks,\u201d Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said on Twitter on Thursday afternoon.  More details would be given in a press conference on Saturday, Lopez said, adding the measures would be evaluated after June 15.      A dozen areas of Bogota with high infection rates have already been placed under special restrictions that include preventing residents from outdoor exercise.  Colombia has suspended all international flights until at least Aug. 31. The government has said they are likely to resume in September.
