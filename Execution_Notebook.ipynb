Additionally, this notebook walks the user through the process of saving the scrapped data to their Google drive and opening the data using pandas.  \n",

However, it should work in ***most*** Linux based Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab environments.  The main purpose of the notebook is to install relevant python libraries, execute the web scrapping code, and save the output to a cloud repository.   \n",
